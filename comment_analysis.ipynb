       "'Happy with it Good quality material however the panels are mis-matched. Product was fun for bedroom windows.<br />Imagery a bit stretched, but still fun.<br />Material is not lightweight sheer, which I appreciate.  Lo unico que me gustaria es que sean un poco mas largas Great bang for the buck I can\\'t believe the quality of the material. Vibrant colors. I have a very eclectic style and this works beautifully and ties it all together for me. Looks different then photo Was exactly what i was looking for. Heavy material. Great for price and ships fast. Looking at the picture, I thought these curtains would be thinner and more sheer. But they are a very nice thickness/ weight and they help insulate my front window. The look is absolutely PERFECT!! They arrived very quickly. I am VERY VERY pleased with this purchase!! Much whiter than I thought it would be and wasn’t really what I was expecting or wanting. Did not use These are curtains just as the picture shows. This is my 3rd set of Ambesonne curtains. I have one set for I use for Spring and Summer, one for Autumn and now this set for Christmas/ winter. They are all very durable and the colors are very vibrant. I recommend these curtains. It blocks views from our living room and front door of the kitchen/dining area so I don\\'t have to stress about any dishes or mess being easily seen by visitors. I put Christmas lights around it, which really brightens everything up. They are private when closed. Darkening to a point. They don’t block out light Work fine for night curtains but to sheer for daytime they were not labeled as darkening curtains so it was my own fault for ordering them.   I just love this curtain!! It is printed on a polyester type material, the back of the material is white.  I had put this up on my large sliding glass door to see how the curtain would hang. The material is of a good weight and it hangs well.  I happen to go outside (at night) and you can see the same print outlined from the other side of the curtain (just an unexpected surprise). The 3D quality of this curtain is so much fun. Its elegant. i love them but the hem on one is smaller then other one Second time of writing a review on Amazon, always and will always give out the honest opinion. Very good quality and beautiful design.This product is worth of buying. Love these curtains even more in person!! Even more beautiful in person. beautiful, the curtains really made our living room shine, was a lot better than we expected. the tissue quality is very good and when the sun hits it from behind, it makes it look like a wall frame (see attached picture).<br>The only reason I\\'m giving it 4 stars is that one side was a couple inches longer than the other. This curtain is so pretty I find myself walking into the room where it is hung just to stand there and look at it for a minute or two. It makes me feel so serene and at peace. It looks even more spectacular with the sunlight coming through it from outside. Closest thing to a wall mural I will probably ever get.  I just got it so it has been up only for a day, but at the moment I don\\'t have the center bracket installed on my rod and it is not sagging, as the curtain is quite lightweight. These curtains are beautiful.<br><br>They are of a light material, but not see through. The top seam is roomy so that they can be pulled back or clipped and pulled back easily.<br><br>The color was a bit paler than I expected, so they were not as bright as I worried they would be. Definitely, a nice addition to the room. Great material and printing on the material! I love these, as I wanted to use then on the patio around the hot tub.<br>they are really nice, and the price I could not fine a better price. there<br>not only for kids room and remain me at the old pond wooden dock. This is perfect for my home and Christmas decorations I love these curtains! They are exactly as pictured and the quality and detail is more impressive than is lead to believe by the picture. At first, I felt like the price was too high, but then I got them and realized you are paying for great quality and craftsmanship. So now I feel much more comfortable with the price.<br>I\\'m very happy I took a chance on these.<br><br>I will note that there is a minor discrepancy with the length from one side to the other. It seems to fluctuate give or take an inch all the way across. It\\'s a very mild and gradual curve, but noticeable if you are looking for it. I\\'d be curious to know if this changes after being washed, but I chose not to wash mine. If I ever do, I will update the results.<br>*and I didn\\'t wash them because they have very few wrinkles out of the box I live in a coastal town but not across from the ocean....so this is my ocean view..lovin it Love it,  I wanted something different and this is perfect,  it brings life to my living room for the season Looks just like the pic! I love it! Everything about these curtains is perfect. We  LOVE them!! These are the coolest curtains I\\'ve ever seen! I just re-decorated our guest room and wanted a woodsy cozy vibe and this is the perfect piece of art. My photo is with the lights off and the sun shining through. The fabric is thick, and I didn\\'t have to iron them before I put them up which was great. Our window was 85 inches from bar to floor, so I ordered 90 inch because I wanted it to go all the way to the floor. I was going to sew them to fit, but the material was sturdy enough that I just folded it underneath and it looks perfect. I was nervous if they would work, but they exceeded my expectations and are perfect! I absolutely love these curtains!  It blends so well with the colors of my wall and it doesn\\'t make my home appear dark.  I like to close the cartains on this window so I can obscure the view of my neighbors junk! Wasn\\'t sure what to expect. Afraid it would be cheesy, as I am very particular but this is gorgeous, unique and def happy with purchase These work great as a curtain in front of my washer and dryer set. These make the room look amazing and everyone who stops by loves them and wants to order them also. This is really Gorgeous!! I was VERY pleasantly surprised by the quality of the material which is really good and elegant! It is also very lightweight. Great buy. I love it!! I would give the rating more than 5 stars if available.  I was nicely surprised - the material is very soft and much thicker than I thought it would be.  It is light weight - so I didn\\'t have to worry about the rod holding up ok.  The color and detail is as pictured.  I washed it before hanging and let it air dry - didn\\'t shrink or wrinkle.  I have bought scenic curtains previously from another company for about the same price - the difference is quality is so noticeable - Personalized Décor is 100% better - overall for price, quality, clear sharp picture and colors definitely well worth buying.  I put it in my living room and am thinking of getting similar design for the dining room and kitchen patio doors. I used this to cover an open cabinet area of a room. The material is solids. Keep in mind this screen is a little dark. I only used one panel love it gives home a beach look ... not to dark just right They are beautiful,getting lots of compliments. Color is a bit lighter than shown. Added a great deal of tropical personality to my room. I debated on buying these for months. Finally did and I really like them. I have black room darkening curtains behind them because I wanted to make my room dark like a blackout curtain. Highly recommend. I returned as what not as advertise. I like it Excellent! Thank you!! Somebody please post pictures. I would love to see what you really get and if they meet the description. Thanx. Used these when redoing our daughters room . Material is great, and the curtains are lined.  They are heavy which has helped block light and draft in her room. Nice material, hang well, beautiful colors, very happy with these curtains in my grandaughter\\'s  \"Evening In Paris\"  themed bedroom.Pink walls blended very well, and brought out the pink motor bike. Love it Actual image not nearly as clear as the on line photo is. Lake / pond very hard to see  somewhat disappointing for the cost. The curtains are beautiful!  Fabric is of good quality.  They are very wide and extra long and when the sun shines through, it is quite a pleasant scene. LOVE these curtains!!!  They are heavy and not sheer so you can use in a bedroom which I did.  Gotta get more now....haha! Excellent quality Beautiful and excellent quality! love it . The description says \"white and black\" but the background color is not white.  It was more of a really pale lime green.  Otherwise, the material seems pretty durable and I like the picture. Love them! Love them, perfect for my living room We constantly get compliments on these as you just don\\'t see anything like it anywhere. They are so unique and absolutely beautiful! We were a little bit weary as they are a little pricey, but they are well worth it. They shipped on time, feel heavy and like they are of good quality. I am terrified of having to wash them at some point because I would be devastated if anything happened to them. They are wonderful and the focal point of our whole living room. If we ever grow tired of them (which I doubt) we\\'ll definitely be ordering from the same company again just a different picture. If you are considering purchasing these, don\\'t hesitate. They are great ! I ordered these curtains by mistake and intended to return them but decided to hang them in my adult son\\'s room as lark I ordered these to use with a room divider rod to block off the open space behind my couch. I put a black curtain on each side to fill the space these didn\\'t. With my couch in front of them, it looks good. My only dislike is that they are not lined, so if the light from the room behind them is on - you can tell. Now, in no way does it really look bad, I just would give 5 stars if they were lined. A unique way to block off a room without building a wall or hanging average curtains. Everyone who has seen them so far says they look good and are a fun idea. I\\'m using this curain to have some privacy from our foyer and it works well. Great idea. You just have to make sure it blends with your current paint color and furniture. These curtains really enhanced the room and makes a great closet covering. I absolutely love them. These are beautiful and very good quality. I love them!!! Perfect for my place thanks Awesome The fabric is so heavy that it doesn\\'t hang well when the curtains are drawn aside. Makes my apartment look bigger! And heavier somehow. love love love<br><br>i used these for a back drop behind my bed Beautiful curtains.  I\\'ve recieved SO many compliments on these drapes.  Good heavy texture and just enough room darkening for our dining room. I was hesitant about ordering these thinking, perhaps, they would be a little kitschy or low quality. Boy, was I surprised! These are GORGEOUS and made of a high quality, thick and well-weighted sateen that is just stunning and very very well made. The picture, literally, does not do justice to how beautiful these are and I would recommend them to ANYONE! Looks nothing like what I saw online. Not a rich dark colour I love these curtains. It makes me feel like I\\'m looking out on my favorite lake. They are light weight and keep the sun out. They are not room darkening but does keep the sun and are not see through. I would recommend them. They looked great. We\\'re perfectly transparent and transformed the environment This would have looked amazing if it where just 14 inches wider. Have to return Gorgeous curtain and looks great in my room! Love these curtains!!!! The colors are beautiful and every one compliments them. Like so much!! It looks great in the bedroom! Be advised that these do not block out much light.  I actually really loved the curtains, however, I did eturn them as it didn\\'t suit the space as I intended.  Great quality and unique.  Thanks! I love these curtains. I bought them to hang in our family room/dinning<br>Room cut out. They look lovely, giving my living room an endless vision of mystery and tranquility, vs looming straight down my dinning room into the kitchen. I feel as if I am away from home and sitting right in my living room. I love it. Plus they are very thick and we\\'ll made. Great quality. I am thinking about purchasing the tree as well. LOVEIT Love the beautiful curtain panels.  They are good quality and a beautiful scene! Looks great, colors are just like in the picture and my living rooms looks great ! This is even better in person! So pretty! My daughters room looks like the beach:) I LOVE LOVE these curtains!  They look great hanging in my eat-in kitchen windows!  The colors are great - bright, festive and true to colors in picture.  Wonderful Christmas setting for my kitchen. Very good quality! Kids love making plays. I got just what I ordered. Look beautiful. I took a gamble purchasing these drapes even though it had no prior reviews on Amazon but I must say that I LOVE IT!!! It arrived way EARLIER than the estimated shipping time which I Appreciate. The QUALITY of the texture is Amazing!!! Smooth to the Touch. The Image on it looks Lovely which was the main reason I decided to buy it in the first place. I placed this on top of our sliding glass back door which gives the illusion that we have a beach in our backyard. It is TRANSLUCENT which allows light to pass through but is not Transparent so you still have the PRIVACY of your home. The fabric is thicker than I thought which is good for home heating/cooling cost. Also, I\\'m sure some will ask but the image is only on ONE side. The other side is white which is nice and simple from the outside of my backyard. The only thing is,  I underestimated the size of it. It is a bit longer/taller than I thought. But is of a simple fix just by hooking up my hanger a bit higher. Overall, I am a SATISFIED customer and it\\'s a great addition to my beach house oasis themed home! :) I really liked the design and the colors shown in the picture, but in reality it wasn\\'t as sharp. These Curtains are beautiful and pretty thick to boot. They are a bit heavy though so be prepared for that. Love these Good quality material and imaging on the curtains. Colors are true to the photos. A real nice effect in my living room, love it when the light comes through it! Love these curtains!  They are absolutely beautiful!  The fabric quality is also great!  Highly recommend. First, I really liked the product and the concept.  Fabric was heavier than I expected and the print itself was nice.  The problem was, the panel on the left LOOKS like the trunks of the trees are black (from the shadows) but in reality, they were a dark teal green.  The panel on the right did not seem to pick up that color (more light in the original photo?) but since I was trying to go with my room theme of black and white and red...bleh! It didn\\'t work at all.  I love teal, but not in this case.  Be aware that returns are on you, the customer, if you don\\'t like the color.  YOu are choosing from a very tiny photo on the computer screen, so try to make it as big as you can before purchasing.  Cost about $13 to send it back via flat rate boxes at the P.O.  ouch!  Sorry I didnt\\' think of taking a photo before I sent it back. I ordered these to use as a backdrop for a Halloween scene we are creating in our front yard.  I was very please how nice they looked when they arrived.  They are a nice heavy duty fabric that I think will hold up well, and the graphics on them was very detailed and realistic looking.  I think this will work out very nicely for what I need it for. Very bright and cheery. We bought these for our son\\'s galaxy themed nursery and I have to say they are awesome! Super cute, silky material and thick. PERFECT! Better than I expected. It JUST fits my window. I wish it was a bit wider. I love it and it is very surprising to the visitors!!!!! Doesn\\'t look rustic, the colors were orange and blue....not brown..... VERY COOL LOOKING Great shipping, just as advertised, looks great. I love these curtains, they are just how described. They are not as blue as in the picture and there is more pink than what I was expecting, but over all I like them great curtain I use these to cover my washer and dryer in the kitchen and looks awesome!!!!! The color is horrible. Not like the picture at all! I have never gotten as many compliments on anything in my home than these curtains. I held my breath and took a risk when I bought them, because they\\'re obviously not your standard curtains. But holy monkeys, these things are GORGEOUS in person. They\\'re very thick, and do a fine job of blocking out most light. They look like artwork.<br><br>You can do it! Be creative with your home! These are the best curtains if you\\'re looking for something different.. From the outside in.. You can\\'t see through them. But when the sun comes through from the outside, it\\'s like you have a picture on your wall, and changes with the sun. Good weight also. Not cheap thin shear like curtain. The image is beautiful ! Highly recommend. There is more blue in the material than the photo shows but otherwise very nice product. arrived on time. The quality is better than I expected. I haven\\'t yet hung them up - but I can already picture the exact look that I was looking for Awesome product used it as a backdrop behind the bridal table at my sons wedding. Looked cheap like a shower curtain. Returned. looks great in my kitchen better quality than I expected Love it These are AWESOME!!! Great quality. Allows light through. Perfect for my son.:) The wood looks orange, thr grey looks blue. The fabric seems nice. Way to big for slider area. Didn\\'t look as good in person so i returned it. :) Not what I was expecting. Print looks fake. I wish I was able to get my money back. @bsolute Beautiful.. @lready lookin to get @ second pair..  Highly Recommend.. It makes any room pleasant. I have a ghetto apartment view behind my window and now I have this gorgeous view... I don\\'t even want to open my window curtain. beautifully packaged for a beautiful curtain! Couldn\\'t  be anymore happier. Best product ever!!! Very beautiful, good material, awesome picture!!! Love it!!! I love waterfalls and this really fits the bill.  I put some lace valance with side panels and it looks even more beautiful.  Also tried it open like a sash look and that is gorgeous too!  I just love this!  Thank you! these curtains looked ok at night but they really come to life when the sun shines through! I\\'m using them on my sliding glass doors (which I don\\'t use much) perfect height and width. Great! I feel like I\\'ve gone to Tahiti! I placed all wicker, resin furniture around this and the next flood, no worries. I put up metal walls, no more sheet rock, nothing permanent. Nuff said! I purchased the 4 seasons print and couldn\\'t be happier. I needed curtains to cover my patio doors. They let light in, cannot see through (privacy), and look classy.  Sorry, this picture is before I put them in the drier to get wrinkles out. It does not look as vibrant and dramatic as the photo. I was disappointed. Cheap shower curtain look for sure. I wish they had wider ones but the 108 inches fit.  I had a problem hanging them so I contacted the seller and they got right back to me and said I hung they on the wrong sides.  I switched and boom!!! Just right!!! Had no problems and would buy from this seller again!!! Really pretty design. Looks just like the picture. You\\'ll want blackout curtains behind if they are for a bedroom. Love em I am returning these curtains. They do not look as bright as shown online and material is too heavy. I also did not like the way these curtains were made, I tried it on my window, and it looks cheaper than my old $12 panels. The curtains and print themselves are beautiful and great quality. I\\'m not rating it 5 stars because one panel was about an inch longer than the other and it was very obvious to me when hung. I did reorder and will be returning the first order. I hope the second pair is the same length because they really are perfect for my kids play room. Very Pretty Very nice and well made. This was really pretty but I had to return it because my room was too small and it just did not look good.  I was using it as a curtain for my closet and had removed the 3 doors.  If I found a use for this in the future, I would certainly buy it again. I used this as a \"backdrop\" for a Retirement Party ---- it was so much fun to photoshop everyone in front of it.<br>The quality of the print is excellent. This looks really good in my window.  Instead of looking at the neighbors house, I am now looking at the sunset on the beach. Awesome!! Beautiful! I bought these for my very dark living room. They are made very well &amp; lighten up the room! Not as vivid as picture but probably for the better. Livens up the room. Well packaged.  Arrived early.  Nicer than I expected.  Very pleased. wonderful quality.I would recommend. It\\'s winter here in Minneapolis and at -23 deg f I love this view in my room haha! This was a pleasant surprise! Told my friends &amp; family about these drapes.<br>Not \"cheesy\" at all--&amp; I am picky. Using this as a 3rd drape (with sheer immediately in front of these &amp; regular drape in front of sheer). However, these can stand on their own as they are<br>not see through at all (even with all lights on inside at night), &amp; during day keep out harsh sunlight but with a low key glow to make view look real. Seller was great. Great purchase! its beautiful Bough this for my 12 year old vs getting a wall mural. It looks great and is of good quality. Makes dramatic change to room and it is not permanent . I purchased the purple flowers with walkway. It looks nothing like the online pictures. It\\'s washed out, blurry and faded.  It basically looks like a poor-quality shower curtain. I\\'m hugely disappointed and returning it. The product is really good! The material is high quality and it came earlier then expected. The only thing is that it doesn\\'t block out the sun Very pretty great fabric quality Need a blackout curtain to go with it. These are beautiful! I love them :) What a very beautiful and unique addition to what I call (my lady\\'s room) a room that is filled with all of my favorite things These curtains are one of those things you have to bring into your home to see if they\\'re right for you and the location you want to hang them.  They weren\\'t right for me because I wanted them in my bedroom, just a few feet from my bed; and at that close range, it was too obvious that these were made from photos blown up to the point that the lights were blurred.  I think, if I had a large room, like a rec room, where the curtains would be at the far end, I would have been happy with them.<br><br>The material was good, it hung nicely, the shipping was prompt, the return easy, and the refund was received quickly. delivered in a timely manner and high quality product I have already gotten tons of compliments on this room divider! I\\'ve been searching for something different to add a little spice to my boring living room. I picked another room divider curtain and thank goodness I found this one instead! It\\'s so gorgeous, I LOVE IT!! Thank you so much! Super fast shipping too. I might have to buy another. ;) I bought the blue Christmas tree on gray.  The gray is much darker than in the picture (from the top of the tree up) and kinda drab. Only if you have light behind it, and shiny floors may it be close to the picture. To put it bluntly, I wouldnt\\' have brought these curtains, had I seen them in a store, because the image is too blurry, making them to look cheap. However, I\\'ll have to learn to like them for the time being. Positives: (1) the curtains look fairly nice when it is dark outside, especially from a distance; (2) the material is nice and silky; (3) my daughter tells me that they remind her of our trip to Spain, while my husband thinks that they are ... origenal. Negatives: besides being blurry they are too sheer. Thus, they don\\'t look good when it is light outside. They look cheap. But on a positive side, they do let some light through... and I\\'ve already returned other curtains, so these will just have to do. Colors weren\\'t as dark as in the picture but they look great up and catch light in a really cool way. Love it These were really awesome!!! Great for my daughters room! Beautiful product. Clear picture, quality material. Very happy with ALL  Ambesome products I\\'ve purchased I like the color but they don\\'t look right hanging. Exactly that I expected them to be like, beautiful, rich color, just ironed them with a warm iron and hung them right up.  They look like they would be see-through, but they\\'re not at all. 100% satisfied I bought this curtain for the back drop in my wedding, it\\'s beautiful and exactly what I wanted These are gorgeous. A little sheer in bright light, but the colors just pop. It has brightened up my kitchen! Makes the view out of my kitchen much prettier! Bought these for my teen daughter\\'s room, because the other realistic photo style curtains were twice as much. I have to say, we love these!! They are beautiful in her room. She has a room darkening blind behind them, but when the morning light shines through they are more beautiful so she has been leaving the bind up. The color in these is gorgeous.<br>I did take the rod pocket and divided it, making it half the size so we have a bit of a header on the top now as they were a little too long for her window. I like them this way better, but right out of the package they are really nice. The quality is great.<br>Very pleased with this purchase! very bold colors if that\\'s what you want.beautiful in person Okay this was a risky purchase but the curtains look awesome.  They block a large portion of light but are thin enough for the colors to shine bright during the day.  I recommend this product. It just looks like the picture posted on website.  A very pretty curtain, but not very good at shading light. Beautiful and very nice quality and workmanship.  I cannot wait to put it up after my new windows are installed! Exactly what I was hoping for. No see thru but not black out. Galaxy design is perfect I love my curtains everyone has something nice to say when they see them in my room. These are so unique. I love it and I get so many compliments on them. The hardest part was deciding which ones to get! You won\\'t be disappointed. My son wanted his little bachelor bungalow to resemble the place he most likes to be, the islands. He painted his walls an island blue, has the white sofa and I got him these curtains to top it all off. Now I wasn\\'t sure if this would be kitschy or tasteful. I showed the picture to him and he wanted to try them. We were so happy when we took it out of the bag to see a vibrant print on quality material. He put them up and said they were great. They really made him feel like he was looking out to the shore.  These drapes are simply beautiful. I was so happy with these curtains - they look absolutely beautiful behind our Christmas tree. My daughter loves it Everyone loves these curtains. Prefect I love it so much and beautiful! The quality was nice, it was a thick fabric, print quality was great, very sturdy.<br>Really made my moms beach theme bedroom makeover. not the same look in real feel....looks better on line than in person :( It is like looking out at the ocean with a seat on the beach from your dining room table! I love it more every day! Beautiful and well made!  It was exactly what I expected. These are really nice and a lot heavier than I was expecting It\\'s sunset on the beach all day everyday. They were big enough to cover my patio doors top to bottom, and both sides. My friends loose track of time at my house and stare endlessly into the sunset. Just leave the door open a bit and watch the clouds tool by an the waves roll LOL. Be careful with your measurements, they are much longer than I expected but I still love them. They are soft and have a nice weight to them. They remind me of stained glass. Beautiful beautiful beautiful I just love them great window treatment Used for a game of thrones backdrop for a party. It worked perfectly for our Halloween display...and it was actually delivered early Super cute and good material I purchased these curtains for a Paris themed party for my daughter to use as a backdrop. The material of the curtains is of nice quality and heavy thick fabric. The colors really stand out, there is no fading. My only complaint is where the the two curtains separate, the letter \"r\" is cut off so you only have the front part of the letter, but it is still a very pretty set of curtains. I wasn\\'t quite sure what to expect when I ordered these curtains, but I LOVE them!!  My window faces the east so as the sun rises the room gets lighter and the print on the curtains is lighter, as night falls, the color of the curtains darkens as well.  It is really peaceful to me.  They are NOT room darkening curtains though.  They do allow a fair amount of light through in the mornings when fully closed.  I love the atmosphere it provides though.  For someone who lives in the midwest and loves the palm trees and beach as well, these were the perfect choice!! love  it ,very deep colors ,blocks  light  and has a heavy weight to it I bought these to liven up our Florida Room during the long, gray Ohio winters! These are beautiful and well made. Beautiful So beautiful will purchase again!! Very good quality!! My son loves them! Perfect Just as it looks!! Beautiful !! nice Received in GREAT time, almost no wait. The picture on curtain is beautiful, not as crisp as online but gorgeous nonetheless!! A great accent to the room, dark walls and honey colored bed set, mohagany Baseboards and accents. The quality is amazing!  So glad I ordered these.  They are made extremely well and look beautiful.  I hesitated with the price because I am tired or such poor quality these days but these exceeded all expectations. Way too dxpensive. Not even worth half of what is priced. It is a nice material and looks exactly like the picture. Love these drapes. Good quality and great design. Warms up the room. Just getting started decorating my new place and couldn\\'t be happier with my choice for drapes in one of the bedrooms. Looks great with antiques and high ceilings. My wife and I are in love with these curtains for our newly setup baby room. I am impressed with the high quality resolution matching exactly what the picture looks like. Loving these curtains! Planning to use it as a photo backdrop for a party. My daughter wants to use it afterwards as curtains for her room. Surprised that the material was substantial; it\\'s thick and smooth. Print design is clear and comparable to photo. great for big windows sliders and small windows too the sun comes in perfect behind this curtain looks real Very good quality. Love them This is the review I would have liked to have read, so I\\'m writing it.  I Used one panel a window for a regular size bedroom window..  It comes with two panels. The panel lets light in but the weight is like a cotton bed sheet.  I didn\\'t know if the panels were sheer curtains and they are not.  They are a nice cotton fabric well sewn.  I bought other black (black out) drapes and layer them on top with pull back hooks for easy morning (pull those curtains back) behind the brass tieback bar. I love these curtains they look great These are beautiful. The printing is high quality and I love the fact that they block light without a shear behind them. The material is silky (please excuse the wrinkles in the picture as I haven\\'t steamed them yet), but these are heavy curtains. Worth every penny and then some. beautiful. looks great in my living room. easily slides on a rod. I purchased the forest springtime version.<br>Well made and nice feel. Much better than I thought they would be.<br>I purchased them for the winter. I hate looking out the windows and seeing all grey. I thought this would make me smile, and it does.<br>I was originally disappointed with the photo. It didn\\'t look like the photo on line. The curtains appeared to be overexposed, ie washed out. The sun was not as bright and was more spread out. However, I have had the curtains  for about a month and they are working well for me.  I am extremely  happy with the curtains and recommend them. fast shipping<br>highquality material<br>piece of an artwork~<br>thanks alot\\' Freaking awesome Have been looking for something like this for a long time it has completed my living room So glad the blinds I bought didn\\'t fit and I decided to look into curtains.  Just happened on this brand while searching Amazon, and looked through dozens of pages of nature, cityscapes and other amazing designs.  This one was the perfect mix of wildlife and my favorite nature element, the waterfall.<br><br>The design appears lighter/darker at different types of the day.  It looks like a beautiful wall painting at night, and still beautiful with the sun shining right into them during the day.  To say they add more life and personality to the room than blinds or plain curtains is an understatement.  I wish I had discovered these earlier, but better late than never. These are higher quality than I expected. They\\'re going to look beautiful in our girls\\' nursery. Beautiful curtain, though not as dark as in the photo of it. WOW!  Love it.  Very nice!  I now own 22 sets of their curtains and love them all. Utterly beautiful.  The material is top quality.  Put it on a dowel rod to use as a closet door in the guest room.  Looking for something similar for another room. These curtains are wonderful quality, the fabric is hearty and substantial while still allowing enough light into the daylight basement. Nice print but crappy material... I just love these curtains. We bought them for our bedroom and loved them so much that we bought a second set for the spare bedroom. They make us smile and somehow feel a bit more ready to open our eyes and get out of bed. Absolutely beautiful! Still let\\'s some light through, which is exactly what I was looking for. Absolutely stunning. We\\'re getting ready to buy a house and it has 2 more windows and I\\'m EXCITED to have 2 more of these in my living room Probably one of my favorite purchases I\\'ve ever made. They look beautiful in our living room and the quality and material are wonderful.  Thick and soft and almost perfect.  They are exceptionally long and I will have to hem them, but that has nothing to do with how great the curtains are in general. nice complement to my living room perfect for fall decor. should allow tittle more  guaging. Thanks so much Awesome Curtains came in fast and look great. I ordered them and didn\\'t realize they were too short. I did love them though. Wish they had fit. That was my fault. Its really a beautiful curtain and we are enjoying the view. These curtains are beautiful I enjoy it every day. These blinds are the bomb.  I intend on ordering 2 more panels.  I\\'ve gotten tons of compliments. Absolutely beautiful colors true to the images! Picture perfect. Thanks for making my \"International Room\" look fantastic! These curtains are simply beautiful! This was a great purchase and I am still getting compliments on them. I might even order more for the other room! They were very heavy and beautiful, but too shiney bright gold for my room, The Seller was great to deal with the return. Love the curtains! They look just like the picture! Look really nice! covers my closet clutter These curtains are awesome. I am using them as a backdrop for Santa Pictures with my Youth league. I haven\\'t used them yet, but did hang them to see how they look.<br>If any of you have used these curtains, can you tell me if it\\'s ok to steam them to remove some wrinkles? Love this! Really brightens up my room and the sun actually shines through it! Great product , thanks for the good service. Very nice very true to colors Although I was hesitant to buy this as it seemed rather cheesy, I went for it because something about the image seemed calming to me. I am so glad I did! It hangs just as pictured, the material is thick and sturdy but soft so it doesn\\'t wrinkle, and it looks beautiful when there is light shining through it - it hangs in my bedroom window and in the morning the light comes through outlined by the tree image just enough to be bright, but not so much to wake me up. It\\'s just very pleasant to wake up to. And it\\'s decently private - I did the nighttime test and walked outside and had my spouse walk up to it with the light on, and I could just barely see her shape, but I couldn\\'t tell what she looked like or what she was wearing. I highly recommend it. These are stunning!  They look exactly as described. Heavy and well made, they let in plenty of light while also not being see through. I use these to cover a sliding glass door, and even with all the lights on you can\\'t see in my house. For this price you can\\'t beat them. Seams top and bottom are not straight, when hung on level curtain rod it is obvious, when measured the 2.5\" rod pocket they were not even, varied from 2.25\" to 2.75\".<br><br>The digital images are very nicely done, good quality. I do love these curtains, although I haven\\'t unpacked them and put them up as  yet.  I am waiting to paint the walls before I hang these curtains. Perfect. Quality just as pictured if not better :) Loved it the material is great Colorful, just as picture shows. looked awesome and the colors were beautiful!  Plan on buying another panel for other windows. Beautiful curtains. Thick and keeps room warm. Not black out as some of the other reviews have mentioned. Please see photos. But when the light shines through it gives off a beautiful view. I really really really wanted to love these curtains. I thought the would be quaint in our cabin. They aren\\'t. They are super tacky. They look like a shower curtain and the color is faded. They are just so bad. I am bummed. :( Love it, i saw this in a friend house and i said i want one, well after researching I\\'ve learnt they had many different kinds so i will be shopping again. This looks just like it does in the picture and it let\\'s a lot of light through while offering privacy at the same time. A good piece for a dark room. It has the same design but definitely does not look like the one pictured. The colors are not even close. It looks more like camo, which I am not particularly fond of. I have not hang these up yet, because I am redoing my dining room. But they are beautiful, I love them!!! Very nice. Great look in our main room. Lets the light in, but keeps the privacy. Good looking print. These really are very nice. Ordered the fall trees and got something entirely different as shown in the photo. Returned it, ordered again when I noticed that Amazon had given me a gift card but I suppose there was a price increase by $5 that I would have to pay. No problem, I want these curtains so I pay it. Later that night I get an email from Amazon stating that my payment had been declined (the gift card) and that I would need to change payment methods. Ok, so I sign in to change payment methods and see no clear route to do so. So I decide to cancel my order and start over. Just. After. I. Hit. The. F\\'ing. Cancel order. Then I hear my mail buzz, check it, and it says that my curtains have shipped which is followed by another email saying that my purchase has been canceled. So bottom line is I don\\'t know what the status of the damned curtains is. I guess I\\'ll know in a couple of days.<br><br>It seems like I\\'m starting to experience that they are shipping the wrong product more when there is a particular item with multiple motifs or whatever. Great hides all my junk<br>Looks like a picture comes to life awesome Came very quickly! I was surprised at how fast they came. The quality is very nice! They look beautiful in my large window. When the light shines through them they are absolutely stunning. Great purchased and even better with price!! I dreaded a month rather 2 purchase this or not  so glad I did..it  came nearly folded and the quality is beyond amaZing...I\\'ll try remember to post pics  (mommy brain) Loved them. Accurate colors -looks great in the room. Bright, breezy nicely made for a good price. Nice perfect curtain. Arrived as promised. Little expensive but nice quality and nice feel This are really pretty the only thing I didnt like was that I had to exchange them for a bigger size and they made me pay shipping but other than that they are really nice I got these for my teenager\\'s bedroom. They\\'re very well made, beautiful curtains! We love them! Totally awesome ! Preciosas........ These are fabulous! These draperies were beautiful however they did not go with my decor I would definitely use them if I had another room to decorate will keep them in mind when one of the children move out after college and I am decorating a guest room beautiful drapes nice quality, my daughter loved them. This curtains is really beautiful. Absolutely beautiful Looks better on photo. Its not worth the price at all. I thought it would elegant in my bedroom. It looks child like and cheap. These look amazing in the kids playroom. Our girls absolutely LOVE them. We did a double rod with a sheer black curtain behind them. Without the 2nd curtain there was still a little glare on the tv but with just the sheer(only $9 for same size) behind they are exactly what we wanted. I was a little disappointed that they aren\\'t white. They are more of a cream against the white windows and ceiling. Beautiful in my room.. Couldn\\'t go wrong with this.. And I\\'m a person who don\\'t like cheap looking materials for an expensive bedroom set. I really love these curtains! These are SO PRETTY and ELEGANT. Nice and Heavy as well My 25 year old daughter got these as a gift and LOVES them. Perfect addition to her bedroom. Speechless.. I love it so much.. This curtain bring a different vibe to my living room where no words can explain.. I enjoy my girls.. Awesome buy.. Beautiful curtains.fit petfect.very pleased I\\'m very happy with these curtains. The quality, material, and look are better than expected. I\\'m very happy with this purchase. I purchased these curtains for a home I\\'m remolding and turning into a rental. This rental home is a 1,000 miles away from my permanent address. I took time off from work to remodel the home and was on a time limit. The person who I previously rented to, took the closet doors off and left them outside for a year. Needless to say the closet doors were not salvageable. I was going to buy new closet doors and install myself. That\\'s when I realized the height of the opening of the closet is 90 inches, not a standard closet door height. Since I was on a time limit, I chose to use curtains as the closet doors rather than take time to frame out the opening for standard closet doors. I hung these curtains as the closet doors. They look beautiful and serve as an accent of the room. The walls are beige and white trim. I couldn\\'t be any happier with my choice to use these curtains as closet doors. I would definitely recommend these curtains as they are a good value for the money. Love, love, love these curtains.  The change the whole look of the room. I am so happy and impressed with this product.. It over exceeded my expectations.. Beautiful print not blurry a sharp image with bright vibrant colors and nice thick material exactly as pictured, love it! I absolutely love these curtains!!! They look just like the picture and they look awesome sauce in my room!!! I got this for my mom for her birthday and it looks absolutely stunning in person - several people have told me it looks more like a painting than curtains...  very good quality.  Lightweight. It\\'s was great. These were purchased for my 14 year old piano girl, and she just loves them.  They really are lovely in her room. Nothing is as ever good as it seems in amazon pics but this comes close. LOVE them!  I purchased three sets.  What you see is what you get - great shades, good quality.  Love that they\\'re white on the back for the exterior view.  Good weight and thickness.  Material a little shower-curtain like if you will, but makes them easier to slide on curtain rods.  VERY Happy with this purchase overall!  Highly recommend! They are lovely, great quality! very love it ^^ Absolutely love it! Our wall is yellow (like the sunset) and the sofa is brown (like the rocks on the side of the curtains) and the curtains just fit perfectly. The sunset creates a real nice and calming atmosphere. The material the curtains are made of is shiny but pleasant (doesn\\'t look like cheap polyester). They are thick enough so that you cannot see inside the room even when the light is on. Very bright and cheerful. Love it! Beautiful Beautiful and excellent quality! I\\'m using this as a backdrop for my skype and conf. call sessions in my office. The colors are bright and the pattern is engaging and exciting, without being too overwhelming.  The materials is heavy and thick, and it blocks the light effectively to ensure that there isn\\'t a problem with backlighting.  This is a \"pocket\" curtain - so you run the rod through the top and then hang the rod.  The curtain arrived quickly, required a quick iron, and was ready to go. Love these curtains. Looks like a poster hanging on her wall. Plus is great at blocking out light. They are amazing &amp; we love them!!!! They are a little long for our window so I had them hemmed in the top &amp; bottom. They are very heavy duty &amp; will darken your room quite a bit. This was just as beautiful as the pictures.  It serves as both a curtain and decor in our baby\\'s room.  As mentioned in some of the other reviews, it is not incredibly thick so do not get if you are looking for a black-out curtain. Love the curtain.  Quality material and looks very nice covering my sliding doors.  Light from the outside makes the 3D stand out.  Worth the money.  I have green curtains on each end that gives it a look of an open window with a scenery. These curtains are so worth it! Nothing else like them! Excellent service also These curtains are very nice and  realistic looking. I hung them in my bedroom over patio doors, added a solid green valence and have dark green  thermal blackout curtains behind them. With cute metal curtain tiebacks I can open the blackout curtains and leave the beautiful Birch tree curtains hanging closed, looks just like a stand of Birch trees with the sunlight shining through. Nice silky look and perfect for what I wanted. WOW!  Love it.  Very nice!  I now own 22 sets of their curtains and love them all. Tis a fine tapestry woven by the hands of 100 virgins from the hair of my vanquished foes. This celebrates my defeat of the Great Dragon Malachor on the Mountain of Erastiz by my hand. Unfortunately taming the mighty beast\\'s master, the beautiful Dragon Queen Cassiopeia,is proving to be a much more dangerous and daunting task. Love these curtains! The design is so cute! But note that they are not light blocking. Sunlight doesn\\'t come directly into my window, so I don\\'t mind that they let light in. I wouldn\\'t use these on windows that get direct sunlight. I also hung these right out of the box. The fold creases went away after a few days. Just received these. They are beautiful, using them under my drapes as they aren\\'t  meant for privacy. But I have received lots of complements. Have not hung it yet, it is beautiful and 4 stars not hung, hoping 5 stars once I get it up. Dear Ambesonne<br>  I love your curtain products and will be asap sending you some pics.to use on your reviews..<br>I have a large house and several large windows..I have sussefully double curtains..to easily go from one to other mood scenes.  HAS WORKED OUT REALLY GOOD IAM TOLD.One of my rooms is called the expanding universe room based on the awesome Hubble discoverys.I have lots of special affects so the space nebula  curtains helped to further add to that room.,More later..please let me know you received this email.<br>THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HELPING MY HOME OF 45 YRS.BECOME AN EASIER  AND MORE ENJOYABLE HOME.<br>  ROBERT MC GOWAN beautiful curtains and nice heavy material The curtains look great and set a dramatic tone to the room. They are thin enough to allow in sunlight so the room isnt completely dark. Great quality The curtin isn\\'t as vibrant as the picture on the website Beautiful, great material. I love the product although it took long to be delivered Did not look like the picture. Beautiful nan Panels did not match!!!!!! I ordered this for a Christmas present and now am stuck with it. I have purchased several others that are beautiful and matched excellently. I am so disappointed and so is my son. The quality of the photo on the curtains is superb.  It helped spruce up our new home since I\\'m still missing the desert. Nice - like having a painting on your wall, a  bit translucent so it makes the picture glow Excellent music curtains, \"love em\" THEY LOOK LIKE SHOWER CURTAINS Is exactely what I expected Love it. For behind my DND gaming table in the kitchen in front of the laundry closet. Surprisingly good quality and print. Very pleased. Fantastic quality! Look very nice.  Helps keep the sun out More light the picture. Good quality.<br>3 stars Deceptive picture. Poor silkscreen with white gaps. Colors not nearly as vibrant nor 3 dimensional look. Save your money. I returned it. These curtains are awesome. I was worried that they would be super sheer but they are not. Thick enough for privacy but doesn\\'t darken a room. Simply adorable beautiful curtains...perfect for my daughters room Looks better online than the real thing easy to install; slightly translucent but lots of fun Absolutely worth to buy! The curtains are ok.  But they are not vibrant.  They look sort of faded by the sun already.  I was expecting a much deeper coloring.  Since they already have a faded look, when the sun is behind the window the scene is totally washed out.  Slightly disappointed. This year my Christmas tree I decorated in purple and silvers, and when I saw the curtains I knew I had to have them they just completed the look. I\\'m holding off on hemming them until I wash them for the first time. And I deliberately got them too long because sometimes they can shrink. This is a mic drop!! Everyone that comes into our living room literally stops with their mouths open! It truly looks as though you are standing on a dock looking out at a lake.. This is our backdrop for the living room and the design focus. Love love love! The quality is good. They are a sort of heavy material with good stitching. The picture on my curtains is not clear and the colors are mostly green and yellow. No dark trees. No sunshine breaking through. I would not buy again Colorful and bought it to use as privacy curtain in an open half bath. I\\'m so in love with these curtains. Best part of my apartment. Everyone loves them Really cool!  Excellent artwork.  Well made. A bit pricey for ok quality.  Colors not as vibrant as expected.  Not purchasing for additional windows. Great quality I did order them to big but they are great Just as was described Pretty curtains that go well in my bedroom. I was sitting, looking at these beautiful Christmas curtains....has anyone noticed that ornaments all resemble a woman\\'s postirier...ummm not joking, the designer could have created a highlight to resemble lighting in on side but chose two sides which are identical to each half of the bulb.  Without saying anything I asked my wife to look at the bulb for a moment, she came the same conclusion.  I\\'m not exaggerating, these are really nice curtains. Well if you spend $70 on curtains, you would think they would look like what is shown. These have the pattern, but the coloring is not vivid at all, looks like a generic print and faded. Very disappointed! pricey but one of a kind. It is somewhat thin but not overly so. Id have liked it to have a thicker rougher texture. its smooth almost silky but i want fault it for my opinion Love the idea, but did not have the desired affect. Might try a light blocking one unless I have a wall to put it against. Perfect backdrop to our Christmas tree. Looks good in pictures. Curtains are beautiful!!!!  They make a huge holiday imoact in my kitchen but are so pretty, they can be used anywhere in the house. Quality is great. beautiful. used as a corner room divider in kids bedroom for dressing area. Thanks These are very festive for the occasion everyone loves them I bought two panels but it was not enough garthers so I had to order another two would like to order more but the price is very high any discount coming soon Didn\\'t work sent them back Maxine I love these curtains they look better then I thought!!!! Better quality than expected. It looks beautiful and silky. Just need to steam out the creases. These curtains are not only adorable but they provide just the right amount of sunlight in. Just be careful when putting them up it took me four tries to get it right  Loved these for my sons room, look amazing and dramatic Look so real... love it. Good Love them! Good quality curtains Loved it. Perfect backdrop for our tree Love this curtain highly recommend So cute loves these curtains When I put the curtain up, it immediately gave the area a Christmas atmosphere without the clutter.  Just as I expected that is why I chose a Christmas curtain.  Nice quality.  In fact, I ordered another one for my daughter-in-law and will order some more for my daughters for next Christmas because they liked it and the idea. It\\'s a nice opague curtain but it is not 3D the way you see in the picture.  If you\\'re considering buying it for the 3D effect, I can tell you right now you will be disappointed like that person who gave it 3 stars.  I\\'m only keeping it because it\\'s nice and outsiders can\\'t see through it to see in your house. These curtains are amazing. went well with my sons Pirate bedroom. The sewing quality is very well and there were no strings hanging. great colors, looks exactly like the picture Poor image quality very dull print not like picture We love these curtains. We\\'re using this as a room divider in our game room, which we have been decorating in pirate stuff. It looks great. Love these curtains..I wanted something different and they were definitely that.. Ok Not as bright as the picture. Bought this for our rental house and it looks so nice I love them... my house has an extra Christmas touch. Great quick decorating for patio doors. I have received many compliments on them. Beautiful, very good quality, awesome.<br>Buy it, no regrets!!! It is not bad, but the windows do not look realistic. Just okay and very over priced. I think this is only worth half of what they’re charging. For the price II was expecting much more... the picture should have been more realistic and more vibrant in color. Five stars!! High quality material. Light shines through, but not see through.  Well made,  machine washable,. I bought for my living room where I have a large window facing street. Fits perfect and blocks visibility from street.  I have a variation of this print in my kitchen. Seriously, when I look at the curtains it looks real.  It looks like such a pretty scene but it feels like you can actually walk to it.  I have lights on my windows so when all the lights are off in the house, it looks extra cool. We love these curtains!  The print on them is great and fits perfect with our decor.  We have a clock that matches the colors in the curtains and they are great together. Cheap material, wrinkled, the sewing is not even straight and looks cheap, not delicate like the picture at all!!! Colors are great Just received my curtains today.  Was very disappointed.  The colors are not like the picture at all it looks faded and dull .  Not worth the price. pretty nice quality and they look pretty cool. they are sheer Very nice Value for money The polyester material looks very cheap. I returned these. I don’t really like the design on it. Not for me. Good quality Curtains were a little pricey since I had to buy two sets to cover the area I needed but they seem to be good quality and I like the design. They\\'re not really black out curtains so I had to hang some curtains behind them to block out sunlight. All in all they were worth it. I am using it like a mural for winter. As such, it\\'s great. My fault it\\'s too long in the photo...I hung it incorrectly on a traverse rod. It has the same feel and flexibility of  a water proof shower curtain. Very fluid. Colors are more blueish than what shows in my photo - but not very much. I am very happy with these curtains.  They are well made and hang beautifully.  I am using them for a sliding glass door that is 6ft wide.  The image is very good and has many blue - grey undertones that glow when the sun is shining.  I feel they provide enough privacy at night.  I am especially excited to use them as the backdrop for my Christmas tree, but I feel they will work with my decor for the majority of winter. I was afraid it would look tacky but was pleasantly surprised. On large wood rod in dining room. Closed flat, they look very much like Italy. I have two metal racks with herbs and plants that leave the doorway in the panels right in the middle. Blend well with metal railings etc in the panels. East window. Plants thriving. If I will be sleeping late, put panels over my racks/plants so they get early light. Look good open, also. Love it. You can\\'t see in the house from outside but it makes it bright in the house from the snow scene...  Just like snow does when it falls.  Love it These are nice but I wish it had come in a wider<br>width! These would look nice in a small space!<br>New information: I purchased additional panels<br>and these work fine! Super fast at filling the order. Beautiful. Used this in our rv. It\\'s obviously fresh out of the package, so it\\'s very wrinkled. For reference our RV is our 89 1/2 inches wide on the interior. I bought these Curtains for my bedroom. The fabric is really nice and they are just beautiful! The amount of light that these Curtains let through is perfect. Worth every penny! It\\'s awesome to wake to every morning Very nice quality. Filters the light just enough so the windows look illuminated. Great quality! Exactly as pictured. Seasonal fun!  Makes great atmosphere and conversation! I coordinate and run an all day Mad Hatter\\'s Tea Party event. This was the perfect entry for guests to \"travel\" to wonderland just by walking through. Guests loved it. Wasn\\'t what I expected the picture is awful. Looks kind of blurry Great Love them look very elegant!!!! Are much brighter in person than the picture.  Much more vivid orange and yellows. Love it! It is beautiful, but my window space was a little to small.  However, it is working just fine.  It is unusual so I get a lot of compliments I am so disappointed.  I saw the beautiful picture on Amazon and was enthralled with the idea of having these curtains in my home.  However, the quality of the product delivered leaves a lot to be desired.  There are several problems, but the most egregious is the inexpert sewing of the hems  where the two panels abut in the center of the scene.  The puckering there in the exact middle of the point of interest totally destroys the effect desired.  One\\'s attention is drawn to the puckering at the expense of the whole scene.  Look at the image on Amazon\\'s website and then look at the photo I uploaded of what I actually received.  No puckers on their picture.  Two other problems: 1. The seams in the middle when viewed in transmitted rather than reflected light are very dark, so there are two dark vertical bands from top to bottom in the very middle of the picture! 2. The bottom hems are not uniform in length so you see this wavy line near the floor. Pretty much as described.  The polyester blend is the type that rough skin tends to catch on, but I find that with most of the newer blends.  It is thicker than cheap blends, and feels durable.  There is no picture on the back, just the front.  The back is white, lined (as expensive drapes often are), but with the same feel of fabric.  The art is vibrant, as described.  Maybe to get this vibrant art, they have to use this type of fabric.<br>They have a faint funny smell, which I have noticed with the newer (cheaper) synthetic fabrics.  I will hang them outside for a few weeks and see if it goes away.<br>I will see how it holds up to the solar radiation that penetrates the glass door I am hanging it over. Oak Decor: I purchased three different pictures, and with each of them, the picture is beautiful and big as life. The colors are very rich, vibrant and full. The fabric is silky soft, flows, like the pictures. It is nicely lined and weighted to hang beautifully. Very well done product!<br>This was the most calming of the three because of the colors. I don\\'t think they could have done a better job. These curtains are nice quality and quite pretty. BUT they are not \"3D\" or nearly as photorealistic as the image appears and the flowery language of the description states. The birch trees, its leaves and branches are very subtle, more like a watercolor or an abstract painting. This design is even harder to make out if the curtains aren\\'t closed and  hanging completely  flat. Even then, few would understand this as an autumn woodland scene or use it, as suggested, for meditation. They were thinner than I thought they\\'d be, a little see-through and had more of a pink hue than brown, so I returned them, but I loved the picture of the barn door. The star fish are more orange than the picture suggests, but it makes the room look very coastal.  In the daylight the rope rendering looks like a real rope hanging there.  When the curtain is hanging,  the starfish don\\'t show as well as in the picture does,  but I still love it. omg I got this for my bdrm window and my daughter said she wanted one for her bday so now she has the ocean scene, so nice Minus one point for not being quite as thick as I would like but very happy with the purchase. They did have a hint of pink hue instead of a cream color which I thought it would be but worked out great for my purpose. Loved it Need to make them BIGGER !!! OTHER THEN THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT ! TO SMALL  !! I have to rate these curtains a 4. Although the image is perfectly printed on my set; after hanging them I noticed they re not as long as I expected. And, one panel is a bit longer on one side. Love it.  100% satisfied These were horrible, nothing at all like the picture.  Had to send back.  Very easy to send back though. Think but still cool after adding liner curtains behind Used for VBS. Held up great to kids walking through them like actual doors. Very lifelike. These curtains are so beatiful! this year I used them as a background for my nativity scene and everyone loved it! I love these curtains I actually use them for my sons closet instead of a closet door. I purchased these curtains for my bedroom. I can\\'t describe how much I love them. They are thicker than I expected, which is great because they block out the early morning light. its nice, quality is a little bad Love these! I got them for air bnb and used the curtain lights behind them.  I need more lights though. no cheap quality  I returned them. I thought they would be a better quality material.. Pretty picture...but it was cheaply made . Took it down before Christmas. Beautiful and good quality. My daughter loved it! My daughter loves her new drapes!:) Total AWESOMENESS!<br>Have 3 different designs and love them all.<br>Looks great in the weight room.<br>Probably would look even better if I took the time to iron them out first. The curtains are better than I expected!  I walk into my room and it looks like the ocean is right there! It brings me peace, sometimes I don\\'t even open them. Ordered this for teen daughter\\'s room. Its different... in terms of what you would normally use as curtains, but she loves horses, and the print is pretty clear. I\\'d like to see what kind of bedspread would pair with it...  The daughter is thrilled! Pretty even with lights behind it Nice curtain, I received allot of compliments Hangs in my closet and bedroom! I LOVE IT! Very good It was barley viewable, all washed out looking, I had big hopes it was going to work for me, but, I was very disappointed  Looks fantastic especially where I have it placed.  True to picture. What a disappointment this purchase was.  The photo on the Amazon website is gorgeous and how I wish the one I received looked like that.  The problem I have with the product is that the hems of the two panels that abut in the middle of the scene have puckers that really detract from the effect that is desired.  My attention is distracted from the scene and I somehow focus on the puckers.  Take a look at the photo on Amazon and then look at the photo I uploaded.  No comparison.  The sewing everywhere is the same poor technique, but in the middle it really stands out.  And yes, I ironed the heck out of it to no effect. njkinj Much better than the sticker murals Very nice curtains. Quality printing. I was extremely disappointed from this curtains ,  The size of the  curtains  is misleading and I ordered the wrong size .  When wanting to exchange or return I had to pay $10 .  And I got a refund of $55 when I actually purchased the curtains for $65 .  The  Color quality and the picture on the curtain is not as beautiful as in the picture . In any case I\\'m not happy  at all with this purchase and return . Bought this for my husband \\'s sports room. Put it up on a long wall with a closet I wanted to hide. He gets a lot of good words from his friends and the family. Everyone wants to know where I bought it. Great material. y husband &amp; I used this curtain as a scene setter &amp; room divider for a murder mystery party we had for our kids &amp; their friends. The picture I took does not do it justice! I would never actually use this as a curtain all year round but it is beautifully made &amp; the colors are vivid if someone is wanting to use this in their home all year! I also LOVED that I did not need to steam this, we hung it up with command strip hooks &amp; 2 small shower curtain rods 2 days before the party &amp; any wrinkles that were in the fabric worked their way out!! This curtain was 1 of 4 different curtain back drops we put up &amp; they made such a HUGE difference for the murder mystery party these curtains really helped the kids get into the mystery &amp; so it was easier for them to stay in character! These curtains work well for where I placed them.I bought them to hang at a sliding glass door, in a north facing bedroom. They are the perfect size and the beautiful image is visible, day or night. I love it, but I it is a look that ties with the rest of my place. If you like dark curtains, that is not it. Good quality. I wanted a dramatic feature wall for my living room but wasnt keen to wall paper, then I saw this and thought it could be like a modern day interpretation on a tapestry, it fits the bill perfectly and looks wonderful, the panels are well made and I highly recommend I bought this for a display in our office when we put on an event and everyone loved them!! The picture is not distorted, the fabric is of good quality and they are really nice curtains. This curtain covers my sliding door perfectly. It blocks sunshine, but not dark during the daytime. Wonderful design. Have a bit of the forest in my home now!!!  It is exactly what I wanted. Great...would be percect if it has a ruffle top seam. @nother be@utiful pair of curtains..  They look exactly like the picture..  I\\'m on my 3rd pair now.. I change em every season..  Thanku so much.. I love it I ordered 3 sets of these for Halloween. They are okay. The picture indicates a much brighter picture/detail then what was received. They are thick and appear to be good quality. Just wish the picture was darker. I love these!! Very nice and functional when it comes to blocking the sun out. It is ok Looks great! Very nice quality! Looks great in my sons room!! Gorgeous, well-made item that I would buy again without hesitation!!!  THANK YOU so much for making such a beautiful product! nan Loved everything about them,would recommend Very nice These are beautiful in my bedroom.  I used one side for my closet door and the other for my window.  I love the way the light from the window makes it look like you are seeing outside.  Even my husband and 20 something boys were impressed when they saw it and the first thing they said was, it looks like you are outside. Love my curtains.  They are so peaceful  it\\'s like being on the dock.  My husband and grandson even liked them and said it was like being at the lake.  Highly recommend them. Love this curtain set! Every time I look towards the sliding door I imagine I can just walk right out on the dock! Print is very realistic and I have had many compliments on them! Great addition to our boat themed room! I first thought they would work with my décor BUT after living with them for the past month they just don\\'t work.  They are so heavy. They make the small room look so much smaller....  I am ready to return same.  Please advise me of your protocol. I was thinking about buying them for two years and finally decided. Colors, details, quality exceed all of my expectation! Absolutely perfect curtains. I will add a picture as soon as I finish decorating my room for Christmas. Not at all what it’s displayed. Cheap plastic like material not fabric. Very disappointed Love it!  It lets in light from the outside too! The picture is gorgeous and the material is strong and long-lasting. I love it. This looks so cool! Quality material. Pic looks like is the shade of a player. pretty cool, my 13-year-old loves it. I love how they look. Very soft. But they aren\\'t lined and it\\'s almost a sheet fabric, so they let a lot of light through. Looks amazing in my lil NBA players room! Super well made and perfect for my lake house large windows My son loves it!!  Very good quality!! Thank you it\\'s very nice fabric I like it I\\'m gonna buy more it is beautiful curtain unfortunately the one I received has white spots where the printing didn\\'t take all over it OUTSTANDING! Beautiful colors, durable- perfect for what I needed. Absolutely exceeded my expectations. Amazon and you, Ambesoone, should advertise these curtains more.  They are terrific; beautiful, functional and a great bargain.  Love them. Do you have smaller sizes I live in an average size town house nan Somewhat disappointing what the product when I received it.  I was expecting something colorful,  lively , vivid 3D high quality digital printing on this Decor Curtains, But it looks somewhat like what you can ONLY put up in a Kid\\'s room .  I don\\'t like it at all. I would not put it up anywhere in my house . Expensive, but super cool.  My boy\\'s Star Wars themed room looks awesome with these hanging in place of closet doors. Love it! The color is just like in the picture. Decent material, I was worried it would feel cheap. But it\\'s not bad at all. Image quality is very good. I use it as a room divider since I live in the loft area of an apartment. Gets my job done, plus it looks great! I just need to get rid of the wrinkles then it will be perfect! Colors, graphics and design were picture perfect! My living room feels like an oasis from reality! I cant wait to buy more! Colors were good.  Would be really cute in the right environment. Matched with my master bathroom shower looks fantastic I love my new curtains beautiful picture Super fast delivery and BEAUTIFUL curtains!! LOVE THEM!!! Material was very thin, not the look i expected. Nice , i like Most amazing curtains ever! Well worth the money! Thick enough you don\\'t need a back curtain or black out curtains.<br>Great detail! I love my new curtains.  I have always had boring, single color type curtains over the years that made me feel closed in whenever I had to draw them.  But these create a beautiful view so I don\\'t feel that way at all.  I have gotten more for my living room and dining room.  Its so terrific to have a beautiful view even when the curtains are closed.  Now, I can enjoy the view of the lake (real life) or when I need privacy or dampening of the evening sunlight, I can enjoy the view on the curtains.  Either way, I have a great view. love them for my show display....very industrial. I love these curtains.  Well made and SO DARN CUTE.  I moved my curtain rod brackets out so I can display the entire curtain.  I looks fabulous.  Makes me smile every time I look.  HIGHLY recommend product.  Actual colors are more subdued than shown which would usually bother me, but I love this print so much, I had to keep the curtains. Beautiful curtains and very nicely made.  Hopefully I can hang them up soon, just haven\\'t found a curtain rod for them yet. The photo is much better than the product.  It looks like a cheap poster and doesnt block any light. I returned them with no problem.  This might work well as wall art or on and interior doorway. i just loved them very calming and unique.fits a large window. Beautiful and very well made! Beautiful. excellent Great look The curtain was too thick, I wanted a thinner fabric! These are so much more than I expected! They are beautiful, very nice coloring, nice soft material, overall just gorgeous. Absolutely an amazing product. It is perfect for a game room, an extra room, and even to leave a candle behind the moon. Very awesome. People are mentioning that light goes through it modestly easy. It kind of does, but it isn\\'t designed for the dark. It is clearly made to look at and not prevent and hide altogether lol. Below is me putting a candle behind it. Looks beautiful. Do not be some leftist victim Olympian and just buy it. Unfortunately the curtains are beautiful and they’re in good quality but they’re not red and black or dark they’re very faded and a light pink and a light teal so not anything like the picture I may have to return them due to the fact that the colors do not match my living room Im using it for 2 years in a row, washed and dried, still looks like new and great quality Not as good as the picture Great material but not true to color. More of a pink color wood This was perfect for my back wall; it makes the room look larger and \"open\". Great idea! MATERIAL NOT AS EXPEXTED, FADE COLOR. Soooo Kool, I just ordered the waterfall one for my other window. Looks so nice in my living room. I bought four panels which make one big picture :) These are lovely. I am very pleased with them. They look great These curtains do make the room darker.  I love the curtains.  They are not cotton curtains more of a satin feel to them or something of that material. I put them up at my sliding glass door, I bought a second set to make it look fuller. They hang nice. I got these for my game room, good heavy material. does not completely block out the light. But has a really high quality mural and material. I have it in a 1000 s.f. area &amp; I have to point id out for people to notice, wish it was more vibrant. Love the size of these curtains.  The design is very beautiful in person Gorgeous! Heavy and we\\'ll made fabric, bright colors..more than I could have hoped for! 100% obsessed with these beautiful curtains!!!<br>Bigger then expected which was a plus and the colors are stunning in my daughters nursery Awesome quality beautiful! this brought out the look I was trying get in my guest bedroom. Super calming after my great grandchildren leave after a weekend<br>visit filled with shear pandemonium Love this curtain. Bought it for my husband and he loves it, looks great on our patio doors. Very good Great scene. Absolutely love these curtains. Wish they came in different sizes. I brought them to a seamstress to get taken down a bit. But really happy with this purchase. Quick delivery. Beautiful product. I think I\\'m more excited than my daughter Not what I expected. Was hoping it was going to be more realistic but that\\'s not the case with this curtain.  The light brown on top of the curtain is real orange throwing off the whole theme of the barn door look.  Kept it because I already had thrown the package info away.  Will not be used for what I wanted it for. Great!!!  The material was thicker than expected so that was an added bonus!  My daughter LOVES it. They arrived sooner than expected which was a nice surprise. They are much lighter than I thought they would be, but they are still lovely. One curtain has some kind of staining, more like a large watermark, it is visible when sunlight shines through it. The mark/stain does not affect the color, but it does detract from the image a bit. Our son doesn\\'t mind, he still thinks they\\'re the \"coolest curtains!\" Loves these. I would definitely purchase again!!!!! My son is IN LOVE with these curtains...they are so fun.  Nice quality.  They will not darken your room though. The curtains are very short!! The are not what they said they where... or what the picture shows.. Blues come thru. I love the look. As described Bought 2 sets to fill out my living room windows. Goes great with my asian theme room. Look great , functional,  and at a great price .<br>Will buy again . son loves them Colors were not as expected Arrived timely and am comfortable with it. Their GREAT Absolutely love these. I am using them to cover up a dark paneled wall. Adds an intriguing splash of color to the room. Quality is excellent. Easy to clean, can be wiped off. Used one as a door on my closet and the other on the window in another room in the house.  They look more 3d in the picture and more beautiful and pretty in real life.  Simply gorgeous.  Thickly-like and opague with a luxurious feel.  Never imagined I\\'d spend so much for a curtain because I usually get them from discount stores.  So glad I went out on a limb because these make the whole room pop. These are more like shower curtains than living room curtains. I would NEVER hang these in any room of my house. Very deceptive advertising by this Seller. I loved these curtains but there was too much pattern going on and took away from the rest of the room. Real heavy curtains, can\\'t see thru plus blocked light, perfect for my living room. Pattern and Colors are amazing, beyond all expectations. I wish there would be more design options so I can buy another one for my bedroom. For these to be described as \"rustic\"...that\\'s what I was expecting.  The material was shiny and didn\\'t give a rustic feel.<br>Returned. Super disappointed. Image is not high quality at all. It\\'s so blown up, it may look real from a distance but not close up at all. It looks amazing in my living room. Exactly as described and so beautiful. I love it! Perhaps my expectations were to high but the photo makes it look solid whereas is is thin and hardly looks like an barn door. They\\'re nice hanging up, I do wish they were more room darkening as it let\\'s in a lot of light I love these curtains in my sons room! They are really cute for a kids room. Loved them!! The picture quality is amazing Just like pictures and I absolutely love them Cheap fabric!!! Does not look like the picture. Looks more like a cheap cartoon image with bright colors. look nice Love it! expected just a little more detail Did not like it Very disappointed in these.  The color feels faded.  The fabric is thin.  The colors, while I know ever monitor is different, are bland, lack vibrancy, and are not close enough to the online picture.  If you want a beach scene and aren\\'t trying to match it to your wall colors, go for it.  I will be returning mine.  Was really looking forward to these. beautiful when out up n the window when the light shines it it glows magically These curtains are very nice.  We used them at work to update some old desk partitions.  Good Quality! Love.... cool Quality curtains  beautiful picture Great quality very nicely made. Really cool in my son\\'s red white and blue bedroom! We love these curtains. They don\\'t hang on the rod well By:Lisa Frazier<br>Nice material ..beautiful design ...love it VERY VERY NICE! LOVE THEM!!! Everyone  love it all my friends and family members Absolutely perfect... will probably order another I was amazed at the size of them. They were perfect for my large picture window. My expectations were to high. Just Ok These were beautiful. We just set up a set of 4 in our basement, side by side, spanning 200 total feet and they are the perfect room divider. I will say that the shadows in the print have a dark purple tint to them - \"eggplant\" is best to describe it. we are adding a couple of Eggplant colored accessories to the room to accommodate it. I like the contrast! Very pretty curtains. I use just one to cover my side door for max privacy and it looks pretty cool. Great quality These are not black out as described I live where there is no trees even with two air conditioners it\\'s hotter inside then out. I need black out curtains to block some heat. you can see right they these there crapola. Gorgeous<br>Thanks so much THE Bottom of these curtains are really pretty but the top closely resembled camo. I personally returned them. nan It is nice to look at, but wasn\\'t a good fit for my living room esthetic so I returned it. The product was/is described as \"High Quality Silky Satin Polyester Blend.\" It put into my mind something like brocade fabric when I purchased it. It is not really silky - more like plastic in feel and sound when it rubs together. It does not drape or flow well and would, in my opinion, be more appropriate as a shower curtain than a window hanging. Wooden Bridge: I purchased three different pictures, and with each of them, the picture is beautiful and big as life. The colors are very rich, vibrant and full. The fabric is silky soft, flows, like the pictures. It is nicely lined and weighted to hang beautifully. Very well done product!<br>Although well done, this is much darker than I expected. The black between the wood slates stands out more when the picture is enlarged as a curtain. If browns and blacks are what you want, this is beautiful. I don\\'t think they could have done a better job. I returned. It is not like the picture. It’s a very light on the fabric and the blocks are huge.  I thought it was ugly Gorgeous! I have used in a room that I have made like a cabin. Great quality! Great price! WonderFULL! Very beautiful. High quality fabric and printing. Nicely packed and delivered quickly. High quality, just didnt look right in the room... Beautiful !! Ilove these curtains. They are beautiful. thank you I bought these for my baby\\'s bedroom and they are absolutely beautiful. They brighten the room with amazing colors and fit absolutely perfectly. Great quality and just as pictured- except more beautiful in person. I want a pair for my own room. The print on it is fantastic, if you have a love for nature it is very realistic. I put it in my kitchen to hide my washer and dryer and it\\'s cool when the sunshine comes through the lighter colors. Exactly as advertised! Just as was described These are absolutely right perfect. The curtains are shower curtain heavy but in a nicer fabric. It leaves just enough light in. I gave it a four because they were not a realistic looking as a couple of the other styles I purchase previously. However it was my intention to exchange and the company was very efficient in working with me. Instead I grew to like them, and decided to keep them they bright and summary. It was an issue with delivery,but I\\'m happy with the product.Nice work!I have a little suggestion.The print is more visible in the dark.If they can use a more opaque,white fabric so the light won\\'t go through so easy,the beautiful print will be more visible in the bright light as well.I really appreciate their hard work and the large variety of the print patterns.I will recommend and buy from this honest company in the future.Thank you! These turned my plain solid wall into a Kool Retro Shabby Chic Art piece.  I have a vintage style couch in front of it.  No need to paint or find a massive size picture. Looks awesome! Awesome curtains! High quality! A+! Nicely made...you can\\'t beat the price! Absolutely love these curtains! Was skeptical at first from the high price.. but sooo worth it! love it Unique and perfect! Was scared it was going to be cheesy, but, it kind of it awesome. The print quality is very impressive. Everyone is rating one star because of the folds.... it comes in a package. Folds happen. You can steam or iron it, but I don\\'t mind. I had in mind what i wanted my theater room to look like, but i never could have imagined such an adorable addition than these curtains!  They do need a liner behind them to block the light from the window in a theater or TV room, but the print is as pictured and as described.  They hang nicely and have a good weight to them.  Fun addition to any room! My daughter loves them went perfect with her Paris room. They are made thick and strong actually keeps room dark. They are very long though wish they were a little shorter. material silky i like that they fall nicely and the light through the drapes is perfect and the design makes it look like a peaceful scene in nature nice privacy with style The fabric is a satin-like material, which I wasn\\'t expecting, but look great for a little boys room. Delivery was fast. I love the colors. I hope my granddaughter likes them as much as I do. Can\\'t wait to see them hanging. We put these in our grandsons (6 and 3) bedroom and they love them. The colors are rich and the letters match up perfectly. The material hangs perfectly. Good purchase!! I love it Nice to have a view when the curtains are closed LOVE IT The red is not as bright as it is in the picture, but I LOVE these curtains. These curtains make our theater room stand out. Everyone that comes to the house falls in love with them. They immediately think of looney tunes or a 1950s movie. There great. I ordered this for my back room to cover the French doors.  It looks nice and it\\'s a great quality. I decided to redecorate my home office and give it a beach theme.  I absolutely love these curtains!  The only issue I have is the sun light coming through the window makes the colors not quite so vibrant.  I am probably going to put some sheers behind them,  and I think that will take care of the problem. I used this to block one side of my screened gazebo... it hides the ugly looking fully exposed whole house outside air conditioning unit<br>Ended up making a backdrop to selfie photo booth<br>Perfect size for my project. Pros: Med heavy, quality fabric. Looks beautiful! Cons: Not as bright as shown on the picture.<br>Happy with product, recommend. My son loves these in his bedroom. This is a great product at a great price. They are not lined, but at this price I did not expect that. I\\'m SO glad I bought these for my daughters room, they are by far the best thing in her room,  super cute, Beautiful absolutely beautiful I searched for these curtains a long time and they are awesome. A fine addition to our Lego room! Wall art with a silky hand and substantial drape. Only dilemma is, which of the hundreds of glorious pictures to choose? very nice childroom curtain our son love it I had a blank wall I needed to decorate and this made the room perfect!  I added a light behind it to bring out the lighter colors in it, and couldn\\'t be happier!!  Great think quality! Perfect! See for yourself! I really love these curtains.  I think they\\'re a little more muted in color than the actual pic shown, but I still love them.  I wish there wasn\\'t a seam down the center, but guess that really cannot be helped.  I am looking for another set, with a different photo for my living room.  Lots of compliments, and our fur baby thinks he\\'s at the beach, and highly approves.  ;)  I used to cover my whole wall, and not just the window so when I go to my room I feel like I\\'m at a beach condo, ocean front.  In my pictures you can see how they look during the day, and in the evening.  Very pretty. Wow OMG THESE ARE SOOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!  THEY ARE WELL WORTH THE PRICE! Was not what expected.  It has been returned Colors were wrong,  It has been returned True to size and picture quality. Love them! Blocks out most light and looks good. No complaints. These are great!! Fast shipping and look exactly as I hoped. Perfect for our son’s playroom. These curtains are nice! Thanks! Nice product as advertised. Need to have the rod adjusted exactly so it hangs nice. Just as was described They were beautiful, but way too big...had to send them back... couldn\\'t return  \"return time passed\".<br><br>This product didn\\'t look good or what the picture showed &amp; I wasted my money.<br><br>they would not let me return it<br><br>I have not had this issue with Amazon before<br><br>This is what scares me about buying online..... thst it will not look the same or work or won\\'t got and you have to eat it and just waste money.<br><br>never used<br> just held up to the Window and<br>I am stuck  it Quite nice, however the windows are not realistic looking, but otherwise it is quite attractive. Gorgeous! I have 8 1/2 feet ceilings and it hangs low enough. It dose not span the entire lenght of my 10 feet room, so disappointed as I thought it would. I added some sheer curtains to both ends and, whalla....its even more gorgeous!<br><br>Yes, its should be less expensive as its only on one side the print.....perhaps around $45 dollars would justify the cost.....but don\\'t be afraid to buy...when pockets allow. These curtains are GORGEOUS! Excellent quality: weight, fabric (like real satin), finish (hems). Can work as drapes, but I chose to use the as curtains in center with wall to wall  white silk drapes to expand snd brighten my living room. Of course the unique graphic sold me on its own, but the actual product exceeded expectation. I bought the shower curtain the next day. Nice, but not exceptional like the curtains though. Both good values. These curtains are really unique and beautiful!! I gave them to my daughter as she has two little girls and wanted<br>them for their play room.  I also purchased the girl with the butterfly wall decals for the wall opposite the curtains<br>When she puts the decal on the wall I will review it. I was returning right way. Poor quality. It isn’t looked like a picture. I love this curtain. You get what you see. My guests at home really thought it was real. So cute!!! I love em!!! These are great quality! I absolutely love these. if big sun not real good Beautiful! We use it as a room divider because we cannot put a door up between our living room and play room (that my daughter decided to make into her bedroom). She loves NYC and when the curtain is closed, the light from the other room hits the curtain just right to really make out look like the buildings are lit up.  Quality material, beautiful scene, happy teenage daughter. it is not worth $70, it will not be that bright, and it is not the same buildings as in the picture. very disappointed! Piece of art. These look beautiful in my husband\\'s music room as a background to his DJ table setting. excellent Item as described. Thanks a lot. In the picture it looks very bright and colorful, but the actual product was very plain and dull.  Cool concept, just bad graphics. Just amazing. Everyone has ask me about these.  Luv Luv Luv!!! Looks great! Sitting in  my office is like being at the beach. THANKS SO RELAXING Beautiful curtains! Not see through but also not blackout. When the sun comes through it gives the room a really nice blue glow. I looooove these curtains and am so happy to have purchased them. The prints are as clear as the stock pictures suggest and they seem to be well constructed and durable. Above all, they look fantastic. Highly recommended. These are very nice curtains; however, they are VERY thin, almost sheer.  I ended up pairing them with backing panels for the desired look.  Shipped very quickly, decent quality for the price I do love it but it did look considerably darker in the picture but they still look great It\\'s little stiff but looks great, especially when the sun shines through it. It let\\'s just little bit light go through, like the real forest. Just light enough and just the right design for the livingroom I moved from PA to SC two years ago.  I certainly don\\'t miss the snow, except maybe on Christmas Eve, but I do miss the flaming foliage. I use these curtains over tall windows in my computer room, and always enjoy seeing it lit up from the NE exposure behind them! Returned these because we changed decor for this window but they were nice and heavy weight satin feel and the pattern was pretty. Very lush for the money. Bought these curtains for the office.  My fiance loves it and love the fact that it makes the room glow in blue when the sun hits it.  Good quality material. I love these curtains when the sun shines on them or the car light outside hits it it looks like it\\'s lights up.very beautiful Beautiful! Heavy weight to keep out sun. Super silky. They are a lot brighter then I thought! They look GREAT! Very nice Thank You! Curtains are nice enough. A little lighter than I expected but not a deal breaker. Heavy material, nothing cheap about these. They are beautiful! Great look as in the picture. very silky in person, I love these curtains Thanks The curtains look even better than in the photograph which makes me a very happy shopper! Thank you! Vibrant colors, exactly as described! Looks great. However, there are flaws in it. There is a great big run at the bottom. Fortunately it is in a spot that is not very noticeable Not as thick as I hoped but they look great! My hubby loves them. Beautiful! As beautiful as the picture. I recommend this product. Nice addition to my holiday decor! Received many compliments as family and friends visited my home. Super awesome, my niece and nephew love them Very pretty and thick durable material. But the patterns don\\'t line up like in the picture. I bought two sets and they just seem to be random panels. cant see picture very well when sun shining, I have a sheer white underneath. Feels like an outer shower curtain. Nice curtains, kind of thin. Basically solid white curtains with something printed on them. Had to sew solid dark panel curtains to the backs of them to keep the light from shining through. Great artwork and easy to install. Not a blackout curtain by any means, I am waiting on Liners to help block the sunlight more. Other than that they are great and worth the price. So beautiful. Looks exactly like the picture. At nights the image shows up nice and detailed.  During the sunlight at daytime, the colors are not as pronounced,  but the curtain still looks like a beautiful painting. Nice thick quality. Packaged with care without damage. After my great grandchildren leave after spending the weekend the curtains have a great calming effect.. Bluer that than the picture but still looks great. We got these for my son\\'s space themed room. He loves them. They are beautiful, wonderful quality and a nice, thick material. These are beautiful! Looks perfect in the room makeover. Very nice curtains, thick loved We have them in our L/R. Adds so much color and conversation. Nice and heavy with white lining. very happy, love them The fabric was great and the curtains pretty but they are PINK not at all red I absolutely love these in my living room, such a lovely complement to our home!!! We have this up in our front hallway, it is both beautiful and FANTASTIC for providing privacy. The way it catches the light in the morning is truly stunning. Absolutely amazing! Here is my review of the custom beach print curtains from Ambesonne.<br><br>Pros:<br>Vivid and well printed patterns.<br>Heavy fabric material.<br>Easy setup.<br><br>Cons:<br>Pattern does not match on both pannels.<br>Extreme color difference between panels.<br><br>I am hoping that a customer rep sees this and reaches out so that we might be able to try and fix this issue before I am forced to return for a refund. Because at this moment it is unnaceptable. Color is lighter than appeared with respect to the green, is more sheer/thin  than expected, otherwise as shown and nice. Originally bought for living room across glass patio doors, will likely use them in bedroom because of weight of curtsins. These exceeded my expectations!  They are a nice thick silky material and look exactly like the picture!  My husband has been to this spot in Hawaii and he\\'s enjoying re-living it!  Backlit by bright sun they just glow.  Beautiful vivid colors! Mesmerizing. Heavy weight polyester with amazing detail in the artwork with beautiful colors and the back side is white. Impressed with the overall craftsmanship and I plan to buy more. Fold wrinkles do require ironing and extra caution to the iron temperature as too hot will melt the fabric. Steaming didn\\'t work. At first thought there was only one panel- super upset until my 4 year old called me goofy- they are beautiful- just the right touch. The sun does not shine though!! These are so real looking! My dausghtrr wanted a beach theme room and these work fabulous! Very nice for Christmas party  Love this curtain.. brightens up the room and everyone smiles when they see it?  They are lovely and block out the sun very good. Excellent, beautiful, gorgeous drapes! Awesome curtains, my son loves these!! Nice quality curtains Nice quality material.Bought them for my teen daughter with a beach themed decor in her room.Not see through and at night with her light on in her room a beach silhouette is seen from the outside looking in. For anyone concerned about the dark versus the light side of the curtain, when it is hung it \"works.\" It depicts on sun shining brightly on the right side [although out of the picture] and slightly shaded on the left, making it VERY realistic. For us this covered the whole width of our 9\\' wide sunroom, and an unpleasant view. Although outside light shows through, the curtain is not transparent, and from the outside the back is plain white. I used some hooks and eyes to hold the two pieces closed along the middle as they do tend to separate just slightly, especially because of the ceiling fan. Great fabric. Even though I read reviews that said one was fine in the other panel was discolored beyond recognition, I couldn\\'t believe the problem would still exist at this point in time. I would like to order another set, just so I have two that match! but that wasn\\'t an option...<br>So disappointed! :/ These look nice and do wonders for chasing away the winter duldrums.  Much better to look at than a snow bank. Just arrived today...can’t wait to hang them, they are beautiful !!!! Warm yellow colors changed the mood in the room. Looks great. These are so much better to look at rather than a snow bank.  The colors are very nice and the picture looks great. Beautiful curtains and very satisfied with the product. Love my curtains they are exactly the same as the picture very good quality Beautiful thanks! Actually quite beautiful.  Nice colors, decent fabric, true to size.  Looks great. I was so happy to see these beautiful curtains! They are elegant and look absolutely fantastic in my home! I hung them on my patio door behind my three foot Buddha fountain.. along with all my jungle statues. They only problem I have now is that when I have company... They get so relaxed, they never want to leave! I love it and I will absolutely order a second pair for my bedroom. Ok, that\\'s another problem... There are so many to choose from,  I just can\\'t decide on which ones I want! The curtains I received look nothing like the picture.  It looks like someone stretched the picture out and printed it.  It looks super cheap, and it was definitely not cheap.  Super disappointed, especially because I’ve bought other things from this seller and was very happy with what I got.  I’ve ordered a shower curtain and a planner from them and absolutely loved both.  I’m in the process of returning it now Picture is much prettier than the real item. Beautiful! I sewed the two panels together and hung them as wall art in an Italian restaurant. Beautiful! I love these drapes.  They are perfect for my living room. Beautiful. Love Beautiful colors. I want to love it but it has a *Defective* spot near the top stitching. Threads hanging out..<br>For the price paid the quality should be checked more thoroughly. Looks bright and vibrant with flowers, very light with pastels and washed out. Nothing line the picture Beautiful curtains make sure you measure your windows ordered 63” length hoping it would fit 64” length window looks fantastic with the exception of a inch short if you know how to sew I would get the 84” length otherwise you will be happy with this item Pretty but the colors are dull compared to picture. Too large for vengue This curtain was purchased to divide a computer room from the living room.It has worked perfectly and my computer room stays cooler with my curtains closed and a small fan. Beautiful material. Color and texture are great. Worth the money beautiful okay Really like it. its good Beautiful design but sizing was not as advertised (96\" not 90\") and I had to pay $12 to return the curtains for a refund. So cool hanging up!!! My son loved this gift! Very pretty. Substantial, satin material, but will need liner if you want them to be room darkening. Love it.  Very lightweight. Colors are vibrant. Only on one side. Will be buying more. These are very cool curtains. They are thick, have a satin finish and a good sized rod pocket for large diameter rods. The slipperiness of the satin like material is great for them to be used as room dividers because of the ease with which they slide back and forth on the rod  I was surprised at how brilliant the colors are - very true to reality.  The image is only on one side of the curtain though - the backside is white. The curtains look great, but they don\\'t block out the sun very well.  They are a good decoration, but if you want to block out light, you will need another layer or a different option. Not worth the money at all. Print is faded, not much like Amazon\\'s picture and the material it\\'s printed on is not that great either. Great quality, well made and nice feel. The color was slightly lighter than pictured so only 4 stars. Love it. I think the print could be a bit better but still looks great. I like this but very blurry is it because I got the biggest size? It didn\\'t look ass clear as the picture just got this today and it is just like the picture. i love it Terrible presentation of product and poor quality.  Wish I could return. Supper disappointed in product and will not purchase from seller again. Horrible.  Not as I expected Not the same as picture but I had spa blue bed spread so it matched perfect They don\\'t look like the advertised picture Smaller than I thought I knew from having ordered lots of Ambesonne shower curtains and tapestries that this large curtain of a giant door would be fabulous, and I was not disappointed. It covers almost the entire wall of the small bedroom I have turned into a castle. I did take a star off, however, for the fact that the place where the two curtains meet was not aligned, which meant one curtain was slightly longer than the other, and the tension on the hem seams makes the curtains buckle a little, so they don\\'t hang perfectly flat and smooth, which is important to me for the effect I\\'m going for. Being a seamstress, I was able to adjust the longer curtain to meet the lines of the other one, and I cut the hem seams in a number of places and squeezed the fabric along the thread to relieve some of the tension so they hang fairly flat now. It would just be awesome if they would have come that way. But these curtains are truly unique works of art, and I am very pleased with them. Bought these for my husband\\'s birthday for his \"man cave\" since he loves the castle/medieval thing. He loves it. Very realistic looking. I actually hung them on my wall in my dining room for his \"Medieval Feast\" for his party &amp; it looked awesome!  Make sure you take a look at the dimension, because these curtains are HUGE. They cover the entire wall in both my dining room &amp; now in the man cave! These curtains are EXACTLY as described and look exactly like the picture. I ordered these for my nursery, wanted a whimsical touch and I could not be more pleased. To be honest for the price point I was expecting the quality to be a bit less and these are nice and thick and the color is vibrant. Would absolutely order again from this seller! These will be great in our game room. I do wish the colors were as rich as they appear in the photo, the color on mine is much more muted than these photos depict.  But the quality is great, they are sturdy and thick. love them feel like I\\'m in the woods when sitting in my porch and so much easier to clean than blinds Looks like a real door! People actually asked me where did I get the wooden planks and I didn\\'t know what they were talking about until I looked over at the curtain. It looks very real! Detail was blurred and color was much more blue than gray. Returning them. Was a great choice. Love it! great product I love the bright colors and it reflects into my kitchen which makes it seem brighter. I knew it was too good to be true. Bummer. This curtain was AWESOME!!!! My son was so excited and it covers almost the entire wall I wanted to use it for. The a little light can be seen through window behind. The color and print is perfect! SO happy! I will be buying my future curtains from same company. Looks great I like the curtains. The colors could have been a little better through the blue and purple hills. I had to shorten them a little so I measured from the hem up with a hem guide which is very accurate. When I got through they weren\\'t even which tells me they weren\\'t even to begin with. Not a deal breaking but it sure could have been better. love it Really like these! The design and colors are great! Awesome!!! Awesome curtain!  It\\'s beautiful! Not worth the money I love my new curtains.  I have always had boring, single color type curtains over the years that made me feel closed in whenever I had to draw them.  But these create a beautiful view so I don\\'t feel that way at all.  I have gotten more for my living room and dining room.  Its so terrific to have a beautiful view even when the curtains are closed.  Now, I can enjoy the view of the lake (real life) or when I need privacy or dampening of the evening sunlight, I can enjoy the view on the curtains.  Either way, I have a great view. Very pretty, fits perfect in the closet doorway.  Only issue, it\\'s a little too shiny. perfect Simply Beautiful!!! I will buy from this vendor any day.  Good quality!!!! Bought this for a fashion show fundraiser. Our theme was \"Midnight in Paris\". Worked perfectly at the double door entryway in which the models were coming into the runway. Nice material and very pretty design.  Looks even better in person. Nice I am going to buy this item again!!!! When I say very good quality and beautiful colors I mean it!!!! These curtains are very colorful, vivid, and pretty. The material is a little different than I expected, more of a polyester than a cotton, but that works better anyway because we hung these in our master bathroom. I made the tie backs so they would look a bit more decorative. Overall I\\'m very pleased with this purchase. Beautiful panels! Fairly heavy. Kept cool in this summer and expect will keep warmth in this winter over drafty sliding door. I love this, should have bought shorter length but I fixed that. Highly recommend. I purchased the curtains to add a little culture. Just hung them a few hours ago and compliments already. Nice but didn\\'t look like the picture, it was not raised out as shown . But I was able to used it elsewhere love the quality and texture Looks really good! I put it over my closet since the doors were broken off. Matches my room perfectly. These don\\'t look nearly as nice as they do in the picture. They look cheap. The color is faded in spots throughout. Very poor quality. They look just like the picture of it on the website.  The curtains are beautiful. These curtains look great. The quality is better than I expected. Bought these for my bedroom and they look awesome.  It gave the room a pop of color and its different than anything else out there. i love it Beautiful curtains, high quality fabric, perfect!! They are beaufiful My room is kind of small. Removing wallpaper, treating and removing the under layer, prepping, and painting---too time-consuming right now. I ordered two of these and put them up around the bed first. It gave the room a whole new look! I will definitely order more---and one of the Medieval doors design for the doorway. These look very realistic. I really like the work this company does! Incredible detail and great quality curtains!  Looks exactly how it does in the pick.  Only Con - Ours is a bit \\'Tall\\' which means it bunches up on the floor...I want to take a star down for that, but its not like they hid the measurements and we plan to hem it anyways... well hem the top over so we can keep the \\'cooler\\' bottom.  I guess my suggestion to the manaufacturer would be to make 2 different sizes, who has 10 foot high ceilings? They are fun, but the image isn\\'t quite as vibrant as it seems in the picture. The Fabric is nice and the image looks great! I used it as a backdrop for my 10x10 RenFaire booth. The design was lifelike. I wish I had just plain stone walls for the sides that I could personalize with my own Heraldry. Really good print, colors are muted as watercolor should be. Nice lively splash of coral and pink bring a focal point to my living. Thick and heavy material that hangs well. Color is more purple than thumbnail shows.  Still like it for our medieval-themed basement. Will make a beautiful back drop **EDIT**<br>I have painted my walls \"Tiki Torch\" (Burnt Orange) and I LOVE these curtains. I would change this to 5 stars if they\\'d change the title description to brown instead of red......I just want others to know what they will probably get. These curtains are well made and worth every penny.<br><br>I am giving these 4 stars because these aren\\'t red at all......they are brown, with orange and off white design. This really bummed me out, as brick red would have looked amazing. They still look good though and they are very well made......which is why it only lost one star for color (not to mention it gives me a reason to paint). They were put up to keep early evening sun from blinding us during dinner, and I think these will do the job. Very nice,  a bit lighter blue than pictured though. Not as dark. Print looks fine,  thick curtains. Overall decent. Probably look better with a smaller size,  I ordered the larger one.  Picture included to see actual color. wonderful colorful curtains!!! they are even better in person, amazing customer service. They look and feel terrific and they\\'re a great addition to the room I used them for. This is truly fun and so different! Really like the image, and the colors Love it. My son who is 4 feels like he\\'s at the stadium watch mess I. These are great. They are not blackout curtains but keep out enough light for my purpose. They look beautiful during the day and at night. My daughter loves it. Bought for my Harry Potter themed baby room. Looks great! Feels and looks quality but now i decided not to hang it in my new studio so if you have any suggestions on selling it, thanks.  Good product tho. I didn\\'t like the quality and print looked cheap! This curtain is like a photo screen print on a silky sort of material. (I don\\'t remember what it claimed to be made of. Polyester?)  It is very bright and colorful and the print is flawless. The dimensions are true and the quality really is very nice. I\\'m very happy with it! Thank you! It was wider planks than picture. It was more purple in tint instead of gray.  It was also glossy instead of flat making it very obvious it wasn\\'t wood even from a distance. It still looked nice but it could have been better. Looks great &amp; is as it appears in the picture.  My only complaint is that it\\'s not 100% white.  It has a beige backgroud that would look better white.  It clashes with the bright colors in my room.  It\\'s also not a thick as I would prefer.  Can see shadows through it from the outside. These curtains worked perfectly in my daughters room.  The picture is not as clear as shown. Think squinting at a distance and that\\'s about how it looks.  That\\'s the only reason it\\'s not 5 stars The color was purple , blue not grey I needed grey amaizin Super cool Look nice my game room Like the print but was expecting a comforter with cotton in it!  My child can\\'t keep warm with this Good product, terrible customer service. I expected poorly made thin material for the price of this curtain.  It is heavier than I expected and is very nice quality.  It is not like a heavy black out drape, but slick-like material and medium weighted.  Cannot see through it.  Hangs very nicely in my son\\'s room. Looks nothing like the picture it\\'s very faded, these reviews are not for this curtain they are for different style curtains. I am very disappointed. It\\'s nice but the colored are not as vibrant as shown in the photo.  I was definitely disappointed. Amazing  My kids love it . Should have got it a little shorter but it’s still nice Very beautiful! VERY POOR actual color representation given online (using the amazon photo). The curtain has many large inescapable RED vertical lines that run 90 inches from top to bottom of the curtains!! The red lines separate each pice of bamboo in the entire wall of bamboo which is the image on the curtains. It looks TOTALLY out of place and ruins the \"realness\" of the image otherwise. No joke, no kidding, you\\'ve been warned...<br><br>Zoom in to the online pics of the bamboo curtains, there are NO 1/4\" thick RED lines depicted in the photos...??? but they are on the curtains big time!! I remember reading this same red line issue from another reviewer before i bought them. Also remember that when you read these reviews they are NOT for the actual curtain you\\'re buying necessarily, especially if they don\\'t list an item number with the review. Sometimes its obvious they\\'re describing another curtain pic scene, but still you\\'ll never know which one. It\\'s still a curtain your reading a reviewing on, and still from the same manufacturer and has the same material - and it may even be an ocean picture or something similar to what you think you\\'re reviewing - but if you check the item numbers that are listed in the review then you\\'ll see the vast majority of the time they\\'re not reviewing the same curtain you think you\\'re seeing 4 or 5 stars overall about!!<br><br>So, when you see that the curtains \"look great\" and \"look just like the picture\" know that they\\'re not talking about your exact curtains!!<br><br>If it wasn\\'t for the red lines the rest of it looked fine, but the red lines totally look fake and out of place which ruins the whole thing. That said, I\\'m returning these only because the red doesn\\'t fit the bamboo at all, the rest of it would have been ok.<br><br>I\\'ve just received about ten of these style of curtains today (Hawaiian ocean scenes, bamboo walls, etc) and I can tell you some are very faded looking and don\\'t look very high resolution and do nothing for me, then others are super clear and vivid/crisp and are going to transform the room. So what I suggest is zooming in closely and if the detail still has a high-resolution then you\\'ll probably get a high-resolution curtain that looks like a photograph on the wall. Because I have some that are spectacularly beautiful &amp; crisp images that pop out, and next to them in the same fabric from same manufacturer I have others that are terrible blah looking faded images looking like throwbacks taken in the 80s. Before I bought the \"throwbacks\" it kind of looked that way online to me as well but I wasn\\'t sure if the pictures were very accurate so I took my chances. I thought maybe the pictures were just poor but when it comes to photograph scenes if it looks really crisp in the pic while zoomed in and the resolution is really high zoomed in then that\\'s probably what you\\'re going to get. It was like that for me. Hope this helps! The fabric is heavyweight polyester with amazing details and color. The orangy red goes into several shades of peach, beautiful shades of blues and several shades of greens and  back side is white. Fold wrinkles make ironing necessary and extra caution should be taken with the iron temperature as too hot will melt the fabric. I\\'ve ordered two different curtains and will buy more, as I\\'m impressed with the overall craftsmanship. We love it!  The print is so nice and the colours are beautiful. Smooth like satin. Not a dust catching weave. Goes great with my new wood floors and bamboo slat horizontal blinds. Fits right in with our Big Bear cabin decor. Curtains were too thick for baby\\'s room, had to send back. Very nice curtains! The colors do not come out as vivid as in the picture but my son still loved them for his playroom. Beautiful as described! Exactly as advertised and arrived on time When I stumbled upon the AMBesonne scenery curtains, I knew my search was over! One of them would make my room unique and beautiful. So I had to try several different scenes to see what their effect on the room. They are amazing! This is my favorite. It is just gorgeous, with brilliant colors. It is a total surprise for guests when they walk in the room, and I can\\'t tell you how much I enjoy it every time I see it.<br><br>The material quality is really nice - smooth and strong, so they hang really well.<br><br>Different scenes have different levels of darkening effect. This one is kind of medium, of the ones I tried. If you need serious, awe-striking darkening, go for the aurora borealis. Total AWESOMENESS!<br>Have 3 different designs and love them all.<br>Looks great in the weight room. These curtain are beautiful! I got them because they are picture of Central Park, and I live three blocks from the park. So I love that I have brought the park into my apartment! I just got these hang.  They are so beautiful and makes my living room shine.  Thank you so much. I\\'m very happy with them.  It also gives me more privacy. I returned this item because it did not look anything like the picture. Quality was poor. Gorgeous<br>Much better looking than my pictures taken<br>Thank you Very pretty and a nice material I really love this set of two. They look exactly as shown and they worked perfectly with my furniture and space. The fabric is very nice and they let in some light, which is what I wanted. I recommend them!! Very Nice! High quality. Love these in my bedroom! Lots of compliments from the adults Not as pictured.  Image is Not 3D as described, more like flat dull 2D graphics. Picture is misleading as to the size and on second looks I realize it\\'s a photoshop picture made to make the curtain look very large and perfect.  Picture becomes distorted when hung on a curtain rod and I have it hanging in a large window. Purchased this to cover my daughter\\'s closet. The curtain we purchased was a little big so we ended up using one panel but it works perfectly. Image is not a sharp as in the photo, but I like the curtains anyway. Added these curtains for privacy and split these curtains between to windows. Looks very nice. Awesome We love the vibrant colors ! Although I must have measured wrong , will need to add valance to get complete coverage of window. Beautiful color and material I was disappointed when they arrived because they do not go to the floor as the picture shows.  I know I should have looked more carefully at size in the description, but didn\\'t feel like I needed to because of the picture.  I think that if there is a picture to show what it looks like than that picture should be accurate.  These curtins would not go to the floor if you put them above a regular window or sliding doors as the picture shows.  To bad because they are unique and colorful. Beautiful curtains!! My Hawaiian beach themed room is going to look fantastic with these. Cheap material, see through practicality. Beautiful and colorful. I love them love these This looks nothing like the picture, it can barely be called a curtain. Really thought by paying $65 I would get something of quality, btw no response from seller. Don’t buy it. the material is high quality, nice and better than descriped Looks terrible  I luv these curtains. Changed the way this area looks, got comments on it and my style skill is not that good but it fit in so well with the brick, it seems to go together like a continuation of the room. I bought this to spruce up my daughters room. She loves to pretend she can actually walk to her castle!<br>The center of the panels didn\\'t line up exactly but it\\'s not that noticeable.<br>Overall, with the image being so big, it looks great &amp; I\\'m happy with it. Not as pretty once received as they are online, was a little disappointed It is more beautiful in person than I could have imagined! Vibrant colors and just adds so much to the room! Didn\\'t look exactly like the picture  -- I was disappointed, but I will use them. I absolutely LOVE THEM!!!!! The pattern is on one side and the back side is white. I only mentioned this detail for color scheme purposes. I am draping these in front of a mirror... I would have preferred golden fabric yon both sides, just because my offset color is black. I can pin it in place, so no worries!! All in all completely satisfied!! Love how they look in our movie-themed living room. This gorgeous digitally printed, heavy weight curtain panel set is gorgeous, well made and so unique.  I was pleased with how thick and satiny-feeling the fabric is, and the lovely woodland scene looks exactly like you see it here on-line. It is truly a creamy-beige background with cranberry-purply colors for the trees and leaves.  I\\'m using it as a Fall back-drop for our street front window display for my women\\'s clothing boutique.  It makes for a dramatic scene, that is also blocking the bright winter sun that normally comes through the window into the shop.  I just love love love these curtain panels!. This curtain is absolutely beautiful.  You cannot see through it but let\\'s light in. Transforms our living room into a magical forest inside. I love the print on these curtains!  It has the ability to transport my mind elsewhere and change the view of my back yard!  It reminds of the area I grew up in as a child.  Magnificent view!  The weight of the curtain also helps to contribute to the heating and cooling efficiency, and has reduced my energy bill by another 4%! Ordered this for my Husband for his Sports Themed Man Cave and he loves it. Quality is Great and Picture is Awesome looks great got a lot of compliments just thinking the color should been more not so light printed on but does look Used for VBS. Looked great and held up to lots of kids walking/running through them like actual doors works great as surprise sheers behind my drapes. great quality!! I have so many great comments about this curtain. It is beautiful. This was the perfect backdrop for our Bible story skit during our vacation Bible Camp Buy it you will not be disappointed! I LOVE THIS AMAZING STYLE!!!!!! they look great but don\\'t plan on having anything in front of them Beautiful unique curtains that get my home lots of compliments from visitors....My only problem is that they aren\\'t long enough horizontally, to fully cover a window there\\'s like a 3-5 inch gap that you have to fill in the middle with sheer panels or close them together and let the ends of the uncovered part of the window hang out Well made and beautiful. product as described. beautiful design So beautiful. Looks as good as the picture I love my new curtains.  I have always had boring, single color type curtains over the years that made me feel closed in whenever I had to draw them.  But these create a beautiful view so I don\\'t feel that way at all.  I have gotten more for my living room and bedroom.  Its so terrific to have a beautiful view even when the curtains are closed.  Now, I can enjoy the view of the lake (real life) or when I need privacy or dampening of the evening sunlight, I can enjoy the view on the curtains.  Either way, I have a great view. Looks very nice.  Is NOT black-out curtain. Very nice, looks great received many compliments this arrived and it is pink and purple... does not look like it is in a foggy setting. Nicer than expected, thick material. Very nice working as the shower curtain Looks great and fits the window in the babies\\' nursery perfectly! i love it Wonderful as a wall tapestry to create a mood. Grandson loves these, it\\'s the first thing he notices in the room.  VERY GOOD QUALITY Beautiful scenery for small egyptian themed room. It is beautiful I love the curtains because they are different. When the light comes through it looks like a misty fog in the woods. I was very pleased with these beautiful curtains that are white-lined. I had been looking for a photo-mural like depiction to surround me in my favorite season. I had really been researching where I could obtain photo-printed vertical slats that would become a photo-mural. Apparently, the only places that do this type of thing are in Europe &lt;sad face&gt;. These curtains were the perfect substitute and add beauty to my decor at a reasonable cost. Thanks Ambesonne and Amazon! I like them alot I receive many compliments from visitors to my home. My only problem is that they aren\\'t long enough horizontally, to fully cover a window there\\'s like a 3-5 inch gap that you have to fill in the middle with sheer panels or close them together and let the ends of the uncovered part of the window hang out Just as shown. Beautiful curtains and high quality. Conversation piece. I wish I could take a picture of these curtains. They are huge! The design is spot on, the material very durable and heavy. I can\\'t wait to put these up. They are very beautiful. I know where to go for curtains! Coolest curtains ever!  I live on the river, and this is my normal view without curtains!  Best curtains ever! They are nice but not as nice as the picture online. I paid $70 because I was so impressed with the pic online. Not worth $70 more like maybe $40, like I said nice but nothing more. My son loves this curtain!! Great price too... Exact size and coloring scheme I needed! Love it! Beautiful!! Great quality!! I love these curtains!! I love my new curtains.  I have always had boring, single color type curtains over the years that made me feel closed in whenever I had to draw them.  But these create a beautiful view so I don\\'t feel that way at all.  I have gotten more for my living room and bedroom.  Its so terrific to have a beautiful view even when the curtains are closed.  Now, I can enjoy the view of the lake (real life) or when I need privacy or dampening of the evening sunlight, I can enjoy the view on the curtains.  Either way, I have a great view. Beautiful  She loves these curtains. Beautiful. Exactly as pictured. the colors are same as the pic . I like it very much , when ready I will post a picture of it Love these curtains but it\\'s printed on the curtains but the print is still so vibrant! So I\\'ll still use them excited to decorate my room with them! I used these for a stage backdrop.  They looked great used for this purpose. Great quality heavy drapery. Bought as part of a Halloween backdrop and will probably order a couple more! for the price I would have expected a better quality drape.  its not room darkening, so dont count on that. and the print is a bit fuzzy looking. amazing! exactly as shown in the pic The picture is clear enough from a few feet away, though it looked blurry when I first opened it. It looks nice enough when the light shines through it (it dies little to block light).<br><br>I have only two complaints. One is the material; instead of being a normal fabric, it\\'s the same stuff as my shower curtain and dome tent. Not pleasant to touch and looks a little odd and shiny. It would be more attractive if it was actually fabric. My other complaint is the sizing. My window is less than 60 inches wide, so a 108 inch curtain is pretty folded, which does distort the image some. Looked exactly as advertised These look like a hunters camouflage, not something that should be hanging in my living room☹️ Beatiful! Nice Love the curtains, good material, feels like I\\'m at the beach when I look at my window! LOVE these curtains - bought them to use in my store front window displays - great quality fabric - can\\'t wait to put them up for spring/summer backdrop!!! Very nice addition to the room. I love the picture. Total AWESOMENESS!<br>Have 3 different designs and love them all.<br>Looks great in my bedroom.<br>Would look even better if I wasn\\'t so lazy and ironed them out first. Mystical Tree:  I purchased three different pictures (full price), and with each of them, the picture is beautiful and big as life. The colors are very rich, vibrant and full. The fabric is silky soft, flows, like the pictures. It is nicely lined and weighted to hang beautifully. Very well done product!  This is brighter in real life as the reds and golds really stand out beautifully. It is rich.<br>I don\\'t think they could have done a better job. Looks nothing like the image. It is printed on cheap fabric and looks like a faded low resolution photo. Nothing of the photorealism shown in the product image, which is the entire point of this product. Save your money. I returned it. They\\'re good quality, just really light when the sun shines behind them so you can\\'t see the wood pieces good. I\\'m having to buy a darker curtain to hang behind them so you can see the wood panels clearly. I love it it is very big bigger than I thought and 1 on my friends come over love it I don\\'t use as streets I use a has a big poster because I don\\'t think using as grapes would be a good thing These curtains are BEAUTIFUL!!! And the way the light shines through them is really lovely too. Beautiful thick satin material and the print is truly gorgeous. very very nice ambesonne is a good company.I bought 3 of their curtains this one has a shadow effect behind the flowers u cant see on pic...it it plain on the other side so the shadow print is in between. ...very nice,and vibrant...I have bought shower curtains from them too.Products arrive on time also We love the design! Wish it were on light blocking curtains but otherwise a great purchase Love my curtains! I love these curtains.  I am thrilled with them.  I just wish they had different sizes. Too expensive and Looks super cheap. Wish I had returned during the timeframe allowed I love my curtains, It looks just like the pictures, it came in signature packaging well cared for thank you so much!<br><br>So beautiful Love the curtains. They go<br>perfect with my old hardwood floors! Great quality- beautiful colors (just as pictured)!  Nice doing business with a company that has some integrity! I love these perfect score. I love them its a great curtain but mine came different . the 2 panels are different . i think they packed wrong Absolutely beautiful! This is a very unique curtain set that adds a lot of style to any door or window. I really like the asian type cherry blossom motif with the teal background. Great decoration for my classroom...very realistic. I plan to order more as a backdrop for an upcoming event! Sturdy curtain.  We are using it to screen off a part of a room &amp; it absolutely does the trick and looks good, too! Satin feel...hangs well as a room divider.  The earth tones allow many options for buying furniture and other decorations. I ordered living room curtains. They arrived promptly, and are much more beautiful than the photo. They are silk with a nice lining. I LOVE them!!! I was so pleasantly surprised. The photo shows a rich in color tree, but the one I received was dull and was not what I expected. It appeared to be faded. It does do the job to blocking out outside light. Just like a a blackout curtain. Love them. Beautiful. Just as pictured. Nicely made from thick fabric.  I have them in a basement to cheer it up, but it looks as thought it would do a good job of blocking light. Nice looking curtains! Really pretty, adds to the room… At night light coming through the very cool… I love ny curtain.  It is so darn cute.  I mounted it over the screen of my theater room. very  nice  to look at  its just take your mind away Nice. High quality and very beautiful look. I really love it! Good quality material and the picture scene is really nice.  The joint between the two panels is much cleaner than it appears in the picture - it hangs straight. Ha! We put this curtain on our screened in porch...looks like we are on the lake.  It is just a funny thing we do! It looks like horses are running through our house! Completes our horsey decor Love the curtains, when the light shines through it looks like you are sitting on the dock Great curtains for a sports lover! However, the colors are not as vibrant &amp; colorful as depicted in the online pic. an awesome backdrop for themed pictures, love it The colors are not dead on but it does look great and it looks very real. I took a picture and it looked like I was petting the animal. beyond my expectations. Love Love them as described &amp; my son loves it! looks nothing like the picture, photo is not crisp or clear Love my new curtains! Much better quality than i was even expecting! More like nice drapes Worked perfect for our Santa Claus picture backdrop! These are beautiful curtains there not seethru. Very Christmassy. I find them to be just lovely. Yes they were perfect thsnk you Awesome! Should have bought another set. Thank you..beautiful. The view does not work. This should drive any baseball fan CRAZY. The background looks like you are looking at the outfield. The foreground is a view from the infield looking at home plate. (Check out the foul lines). Recommendations: turn the home plate and foul lines around I originally got these for my sliding glass door but after having them hung a few days realized that it was bothersome to open and close everytime the dog needed to go out. I didn\\'t want to return them so I racked by brain and came up with an alternative! I have a large closet in my master B\\'room that had three sliding louvered doors on it which attracted dust like crazy and were hard to clean. I took them down and replaced them with sheets hung on a cable. This was sufficient, not all that attractive but it served the purpose.<br>I got the idea to use these instead. I purchased on Amazon a long tension rod which works great and slide the curtains on and placed it in the opening. They fit perfectly length wise and since they are closed most of the time give us a beautiful \\'Island View\\' AND what\\'s even better is that when I turn on the closet light it back lights the scene and makes you feel like you have the beach right outside your bedroom.<br><br>These are a heavy weight satin and the color is rich, and true to the photo. The blue is very sky like, no off colors on any of it. I would recommend getting this to turn any room into a wonderful vista. You could even install a rod on a wall and display these. They are matched up just perfectly so when closed you don\\'t see a line. Beautiful and fun. It does block some of the bright Florida sun that comes in my  eastern-facing patio door, but it not make our room dark as night but close. Good quality and the picture is really fantastic. It makes me happy. This gets a lot of compliments and is a fantastic addition to my home. The quality is perfect and adds so much more personality to my humble abode. There was enough material for me to make a ruffle on the top and still have a great length. I love the material has a great feel Love the curtains.  Fits perfectly in my beach themed party room. Love it my granddaughter love leopard Beautiful just love them These curtains were fairly expensive so assumed they would look like pics. Sorely disappointed. They look cheap and are fairly see through. Disappointed because I had such high expectations Really like these. They are nice and heavy but yet allow a lot of warm light in. These are very nice adds a nice warm cozy<br>Feeling to the room Colors aren\\'t as rich as photo. Not as clear. Love it ! Good quality and the print looks amazing when sunlight hits. Looks great, feels great! Thanks a lot! Love this!  Great quality. Looks amazing. Love it! Looks great! This curtains are beautiful. They were so much more then I expected. Not see through at all like some reviews said. Good quality. I\\'m so very happy with them. Everybody who visit me is GA GA over my curtains.  Instant interior make over.  I\\'m so happy. Love them These are the absolute coolest curtains I have ever seen!  We put timer lights in the bay window and at night it looks like flashlights coming in through the woods! I originally bought one set, but ended up ordering two more. High quality curtains! Pictures do this no justice. Looks so good in person and fits my window very well. I ended up ordering them for my whole house. As advertised - a real bargain. These curtains are telling a story everyday in my dining room. I love them! The material is silky and did not need to be ironed. Perfect! I get so many compliments on this. I love this curtain...very beautiful I wish I could give these curtains 100 stars... I love them beatiful! It makes it feel like you are outside. Beautiful curtains. They ate truly worth every penny. You won\\'t be disappointed. Love it!! High quality product! Came just as advertised. Id buy it again if needed! I\\'m a Massage Therapist and I have these in my spa room. My clients love it! I put blackout curtain liners behind it.. otherwise light will show through. I love the brand! These are my 2nd curtains and will buy more for whenever I decide to change up. Very pretty. Light colors. Not vibrant and overpowering. looks awesome matched up with 2 other side curtains to cover 20ft. of window space dont match perfect but we love the way it all looks together.came sooner than expected by mail very happy.with amazon packing and shipping thank you!!!!!! They really brighten up the room.  I\\'m happy with them.<br>Con: they don\\'t com pleated as in the picture.  Guess I\\'ll have to \"train them\". These curtains are a fun touch for my sons room. Note- they need a shade or blinds behind them. These curtains are terrible! The material is cheap and fraying right out of the package.  They look terrible! Worst buy ever! The quality is impeccable! Beautiful! Will use these in winter, since they are heavier than the other pair I ordered and also fell in love with! thin but beautiful. Very good look good every one like it Absolutely beautiful LOVE LOVE LOVE these Drapes. I use them as backdrops for my DS business booths. Coupled with LimoStudio Photo Video Studio 10Ft Adjustable Muslin Background Backdrop Support System Stand, AGG1112 Hundreds of designs to choose from- fast shipping! The colors are not nearly as bright and vibrant as they are in the product display picture. Additionally, the curtains are fairly thin and do not block out much sunlight. Beautiful.  I love them. Very beautiful Love these curtains. Really nice quality and beautiful sky picture. Look pretty cheap beautiful but it will make room darker My daughter loved these curtains so we had to buy them.  They were longer then we would like so had to have them brought up but they are definitely a hit with her and look great in her bedroom.  We have a colonial style house and put one curtain on each front window in her room. Colors are not as bold as the picture but still looks good. Just had a house warming party &amp; everyone complimented me on my curtain \"view.\"  It\\'s functional AND a great image when I wake in the morning (especially when the wind is gently blowing thru my windows!) There good wish they would make this in a thicker curtain fantastic curtains..goes well with my red leather sofa I love it!!!<br> THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!  My husband bought these for our living room and I couldn\\'t be more pleased.  The best part about these is that they look like they\\'re glowing during the day.  They\\'re thick enough to keep the sun out, but thin enough to actually glow like the real Northern Lights. <br><br>SUPER wrinkled...I really like these! The price was a little steep but they really brighten a room compared to regular drapes. The colors are only a bit muted as some other reviews have noted. They are light but still block most light, they are adequate for privacy (we hung these on a patio door). I shared one photo with the lights on and one off. They look REALLY nice with low light in the morning. I\\'m writing this review  And giving this product five stars due to the fact they exceeded my expectations . I read a lot of Reviews  before I purchase them and I would have to say they are very lovely. I would highly recommend them Love these curtain in our under the sea room. Perfect, beautiful, life like! Color is dull. Not vibrant like it shows here.<br><br>Update:<br>I mention the color is dull. That is how they look during the day with sunlight (directly or indirectly) coming through the window. At night these curtains have a really nice look to them.<br><br>I realized that is what I should have expected because of the way color works. We get color from light. All things reflect color that is carried inside the light, so when the sun is shining through the curtains they will be washed out by all that non reflective color inside the sun light. There is no way to project a level set of vibrant color onto the curtains by way of back lit lighting like the sunlight.<br><br>Now understanding the reality of how color works, I am changing my 3 star rating to a 4. I wish they would have presented 2 pictures in their product. One with no back lighting and one with the sun shinning from behind.<br><br>Here is a picture taken from my phone of the curtains with the morning sun shining directly behind. I like this curtain! I hate the rabbit though. It\\'s got shaggy hair and looks kinda scary. The material is sturdy and has a nice feel. The scenery and how the light shines through the trees is very serene during the day. It also allows just enough light to not be very bright yet you\\'re still able to read the newspaper in the room. At night if you have a lamp on, the image can be seen from outside which I\\'m not too fond of but that\\'s not that big of a deal to me. I would recommend this for a bedroom or dining room picture window. Exactly as pictured and nice textured material.  They are not exceptionally thin or heavy but work just right for my climate.  Paler colors are more transparent than the darker areas, so don\\'t expect blackout curtain effects. This is large and beautiful.  It looks amazing with light coming through behind it. I do love it but it did look considerably darker in the picture but they still look great Love and love it!! It makes my living room look like paradise lol! ❤️ Use this as a curtain over my sliding glass door. When the sun comes up in the morning it looks like you\\'re looking out onto the beach. They are absolutely wonderful and a very digital picture do not know how they could get it on a curtain and it looks so real. Fantastic Everything I expected and more...They really brightened up my living room, in the afternoon when the sun hits them they give off a green tint in the whole room. Color is fantastic very bright and well made. I love them !! These are thicker and heavier than I expected. Color was lighter than expected. I thought it was going to be more detailed. It is a bit too expensive just for a curtain this quality. I wouldn\\'t complain if this was like 50 dollar. Beautiful, remind me of the islands. very nice I love these curtains! High quality, non-fading fabric with brilliant colors. Nice material &amp; very pretty. Absolutely love them Just as advertised These were absolutely beautiful, and exactly as described.  They look wonderful.  I recommend them. The quality is very good,I will buy them again, that\\'s all my bedroom needed. a room divider with scenery... the kids love it Absolutly amazing. However this print was a bit too dark for me. I like them but want something that matches my decor better. I like the Aqua curtains Hawaiian decoration sunbeams through dark clouds shoreline and Natural Waterfall clear curtains grand waterfall wrh swans better. Beautiful curtains with vivid color. I\\'m looking for a battery and charger for a 36V  500W of a rear wheel bike Just what i wanted .  Thank you Ocean view room 3 miles from the beach - Fantasizing about my vacation 4 months in advance.  Easy to hang, measurements were exact.  High quality.  I am very happy!  Lightning fast shipping!  A++++ LOVE these curtains. .. hung them in front of our washer/dryer area... NICE quality... would look better on a larger window where you can see all the detail...big bang for your buck!!!!! Great quality.  Soft, thick fabric.  Some light comes through but they significantly darken the room. These are great curtains.  They look really good in my daughter\\'s bedroom. good quality; looks great Beautiful It turns my guest room into a tropical oasis.  Having grown up in Hawaii, in Kailua, this is a very familiar scene!  Love it!  When the sun shines through it is like a sunrise on the beach. Beautiful. My daughter was thrilled with the picture on the curtain. Hangs nicely. Overall  not bad, but not as realistic looking as I  expected.  Material is thick which is good, but a bit too dark for my taste. THE PICTURE IS DECIEVING THICK HEAVY SILKY MATERIAL Great ! Awesome I look out to a patio of snow and below 0 temps makes the winter\\'s in North Dakota depressing so I added these to my studio. The color is so vivid, I love looking at these and think, it\\'s another great beach day!  And they do keep out the cold! It looks faded by the sun like I got a used one I was really wanting to love it VERY SAD and disappointed. Very realistic returned product. poor detail. Very nice curtains Not good material ,cheap with that price Looks 3D and like an it extends the room making the room look larger in the picture, but not in real life.<br><br>In real life this curtain more than makes up for it though because it is one of the most beautifulest and prettiest picturesque things/curtains I have ever seen.  If I could rate this curtain a 10, I WOULD!!  It arrived late last night, I put it up and between then and this morning I have made trips into my living room just to look and admire.  Can\\'t wait til I get home to look at it again.<br><br>My title is an excellent curtain for the winter.  I said that because by looking at the picture, it looks like it could possibly be some thin, sheer curtain but in real life it\\'s the polar opposite, which makes it a wonderful curtain for this time of year (winter).<br><br>Never thought in my life I\\'d spend nearly $70 for a curtain but instead something nice and do-able from a department store.  It is worth every penny.  Yes, I\\'m raving about this curtain because it is that beautiful and pretty.  One of the windows don\\'t line up in real life like the picture and the thing about this curtain is it\\'s so beautiful and pretty that it doesn\\'t even matter.<br><br>Fits the colour scheme of my living room perfectly.<br><br>The system only allows five stars but in my own way, I\\'m giving it ten.  * * * * * * * * * * I love these curtains everything is right with them, the size and design is great Great Look really good, very 3D. These curtains look just like the picture.  They are awesome.  I would definitely recommend them. I love these curtains.  We renovated our bathroom and I purchased these to \"hide\" the washer/dryer. They are nice and thick and great quality.  So thick you can\\'t see the washer/dryer behind them - looks like the wall/mural.  I get tons of compliments on the new bathroom - and these curtains - from my friends.  Would definitely purchase them again! Nice curtains, but looks different from the one in the photo, for one the design is different, duller, and the curtains aren\\'t as long as I had expected them to be, but since the curtains fit my window nicely I am giving these curtains a thumbs up. These curtains were perfect for my St Paddys day party.. good material and not cheap looking at all. I hung them on a backdrop stand and used it as a type of photo booth Super fast shipping and we just love our curtains. They are so unusual and match our rustic theme perfectly.  Perfect size, nice quality, lined so you cannot see thru them.  We were skeptical to order but we couldn\\'t love them more.  We used a double rod and instead of using a valance , went to the craft and hobby store and bought garland to wrap the rod and it just looks awesome.  We couldn\\'t have been more pleased with this order. I was skeptical ordering this because I wasn\\'t sure of the quality of the material. I was surprised by the nice weight of the curtain and by the colorful print. The colors really are this vivid in person. We use it for a backdrop in my husband\\'s music room. It really gives it a fun feel in the room. I would buy again! Goes well with my asian decor for garden bath, provides privacy but still allow some light. perfect. great product. was pleased very much. Looks great in a living room. Nice touch when light shines though, good quality. Beautiful, clear print. These look very nice during the day, the sun shining on the back really brings out the color in them, which adds a sort of night effect after dark , darkening the overall image. My only gripe is a wish they were heavier curtains for the price. I had $20 curtains before these that are twice as heavy and just hung better, will be adding weights to these to correct it but they do look very nice. The design is very true to the picture and the curtains look good.  My only complaint is that the curtains are white on the back, and they appear to be made from a synthetic material which I wasn\\'t thrilled about, but as I said, they do look good in our home. Awesome! looks just like the picture. I am using it as a backdrop for an Paris theme event. Good heavy material I love them! They look great in my living room! They are great quality as well. Beautiful!!!!!! He loves it.  Great color Granddaughter loved these curtains.  Colors are bright as in the picture. Our little princesses love the look it gives their bedroom. It is heavier than I thought it would be. I was expecting drapery sheets and we got drapes. Looks beautiful in my daughters room, fits her window perfectly. Colors are so vibrant and it\\'s a decent material. Very happy. very nice These curtains are well made, they fit well and look great.  I have not washed yet but I have confidence they will be fine if I follow directions.  They had normal fold lines when I unpacked them which pressed out easily.  I am very happy with my purchase. Was amazed at the quality, for the price. We are creating a tropical spare bedroom and needed curtains to match a yellow wall.  These are very elegant and hang nicely. Good These are beautiful and good quality! I bought the forest trees in the mist curtains.  I was VERY disappointed when I opened them up and saw that they look really faded compared to the picture here on Amazon.  But, I hung them up anyway because I didn\\'t have any curtains and my neighbor had at attempted break-in a few days before and I was feeling exposed.<br><br>They do NOT look good closed during the day as so much light shines through that you cannot see the picture at all; however, since I don\\'t want them closed during the day, that\\'s okay.  They look better at night.  I went outside at night to see if I could see in at all when the lights are on and I couldn\\'t see anything.  So, they serve the main purpose of privacy at night.<br><br>I do wish that they were brighter, but having something green to look at is very restful, so I have no desire to mess with sending them back.  They\\'ve definitely grown on me...I liked them a lot less when I first got them. I am in love with these curtains! Very nice quality fabric with a good weight to it. Vibrant, detailed printing of the beautiful galaxy design. They are NOT black-out curtains, but the way the sun filters through the fabric is quite nice. Plenty of coverage for privacy, you definately cannot see through from the outside, and the backside is white for street side view. Perfect addition to my son\\'s space/ Star Wars themed room. I first was skeptical of the price, but now that I have them in hand I can see they were definitely worth the price. This got a huge wow factor from our three year old when I put this in his room. I secretly love them too! The quality is super great, and still allows a little bit of sunshine though (which I prefer). The longer size actually covered both windows when I turned it sideways, which gives me an extra for the future. Worth the price! Curtains we high quality and seem to be very durable.  They fit just right, this is definitely a get it. It is what I ordered. Exactly what I expected. These were absolutely beautiful, and exactly as described.  They look wonderful.  I recommend them. love it!! Great covering for basement garage door! I wish the colors and the dark areas were a little more intense.  Still very nice. To orange. We were very happy with our purchase. It was all we thought it would be Image looks great. Using for backdrop. Love it! It makes the living room. These are awesome.  The photo quality is great. very cool, lets a surprising amount of light in, a little too much for my tastes. Still very nice Very nice I like these curtains but at night they look orange Love the pattern,wish they were thinner,but love them Didn\\'t think this was a silky material.  Almost like a shower curtain , they are also hard to get wrinkles out of but the picture is pretty I bought the Saguaro Cactus Sunset View at the Desert curtains and they are just as beautiful as I hoped.  The silky satin polyester blend is super!  Very nice quality and LOVELY GRAPHICS!  I wish I had more windows to hang some of the other beautiful ones they have. (I\\'ll be re-examining my rooms.  Lol)  The picture I uploaded is during the day with the sun shining in which gives it a desert-during-the-day look.  (I don\\'t have a night-time picture but it looks more like the picture on the product listing.)  VERY nice.  A worthy investment.  Thanks, Ambesonne, for offering such wonderful scenic curtains.  There were so many beautiful ones I had a hard time choosing, but the wait was SO worth it!  :-D It looks really awesome Fantastic, just what I wanted!!! Came is record time! Perfect!!! 100% polyester and the craftsmanship seems well done and symmetrical.  I would definitely recommend this vendor again due to the material, selection of images, and good quality.  In fact I am trying to come up with a plan to hang this curtain with a different pattern in my bathroom in front of the shower and bath tub.  Out of the box I let the curtain hang for a few days to see if the fold marks would work themselves out but in the end I just went ahead and ironed them out.  Instructions say to keep the iron on a low/medium setting (did I mention 100% synthetic?).<br><br>From the vendor\\'s picture it makes it look like the curtain might extend above the rod but it is the standard hanging curtain.  The rod threads through a 3\" loop at the top.  I got this curtain for a room I use for my office by day and PC gaming room by night.  I have all kind of swords, shields, double-sided axes, etc hung around the room but this curtain is truly the centerpiece.  Different LED lights bring out different artwork and really makes this piece look great. These curtains are amazing! I can\\'t stop admiring them with a smile on my face! They surpassed my expectations for the price I paid. The colors are exact to the image presented and the texture is great. Would absolutely positively recommend to anyone who\\'s interested Very, very pretty. It changed the entire look of a bedroom! The quality of the curtain was excellent, but the image/printing was not sharp. those are very nice curtains and they look just awesome on the wall Good They are made of a very cheap fabric, it\\'s very thin, stiff, and almost look through,  therefore the curtains do not look solid and colorful as  on the photos,  it\\'s not sharp and bright, and stitches are not even, the fabric is pulling creating uneven look.  I like the idea, but the quality is very poor. Very nice space scene curtains for sons room.  Fast shipping.  They don\\'t block out a lot of light, which is actually a plus as h8s room is not well lit.  Quality seems pretty good, and price is on part or less than comparable curtains we looked at.  Will probably get another set for our other sons room. I actually put this in my bedroom and it works perfectly it keeps the sun out and at the same time brings a pleasant amount of light in the middle of the curtains when they are closed. It has completely changed the room and made everything look better. I am so glad that I bought it and I hope to buy another one soon. I didn\\'t like the quality and print looked cheap! Very pleased with quality of curtains, and prompt shipment. Great for home or photo studio. I really love what I got. I give it 4 stars and not 5, only because the green is somewhat lighter than I thought. But it still works. A most awesome looking \"tapestry\". It looks great in my living room. If only I could afford a real castle...... Absolutely beautiful and very chic. Colors were so vivid it was hard to believe they were curtains. The teals were so bright! LOVE LOVE  LOVE these Drapes. I use them as backdrops for my DS business booths. Coupled with LimoStudio Photo Video Studio 10Ft Adjustable Muslin Background Backdrop Support System Stand, AGG1112 Thank you! I was dissapointed when I 1st received curtains! Not as authentic looking as display pic, very shower curtainesque! But I decided to hang in my living room anyway to see full effect of look I\\'m trying to create  ( morrocon or middle eastern motif) Hoping more accessories will give me look i\\'m going for since curtains did not. Good qaulity though.... These are perfect! Made my nephews new pirate room look totally perfect! A+++++ My curtain are not vivid at all. The colors seem washout out. Not pretty and mesmerizing like the picture. I love these curtains. Awesome The material is not what I expected These are great for a wolf loving middle school kid. Awesome image on curtain. Looks like a million bucks except there are tourists all over the beach!! Didn\\'t notice it in the pic. no complaints Absolutely love these curtains! Thanks Beautiful  She loves these High quality curtains, stunning design. Exactly as advertised and an excellent price! I got this for my daughters room and she loves them. They are good quality. Awesome!!! They are sooo Beautiful! I am more than happy with my purchase. Great quality and I got them on time. Nice Got the job done, well! Used to seperate basement space. This curtain is very nice. The only draw back is that when you get in person it feels unbalanced because there is not a whole lot going on on the left panel. However, I am glad that the rock is not split between the two panels.<br><br>The picture is surprising crisp (and I have another, different print curtain that is not crisp, so I can truly speak from experience).<br><br>The sewing lines are off, and the picture is maybe 1 mm higher on one panel but unless you get on a ladder or crawl on your knees and stare at it for a time, you will only notice when you take them down or put them up. for the right house/room, these panel curtains would be awesome. i decided to return them because the fabric was shiny/silky material, and i expected it to be a heavier linen/cotton material. that being said, they look pretty funky and seemed well-made. The photos I took are just the panels flung up over the curtain rod to mimic the look; they are not really hung up the correct way, so don\\'t judge the way they look completely by the photo; it\\'s just sort of to give you an idea what the colors and pattern and material looks like in a \"real\" living room. This item looks NOTHING like the photo! It is at best a $10 product. The material is cheap. The pattern is huge compared to what is pictured and the colors are very faded -- the colors are NOT vivid as pictured!  I opened the box so excited-- 2 of my neighbors were over and all were blown away by how cheap and faded they are. What a disappointment! Not worth more than $10 or less. Not recommended. There seems to another review that item is not as described, so I\\'m including a photo for other consumers interested in purchasing this product. Decent material, but the color isn\\'t really as depicted - it\\'s more orange-y, not vibrant at all like it shows in the ad picture. Also these curtains are fairly sheer and let quite a bit of light in. The print is a little lighter than pictures. The definition isn\\'t as crisp as pictured either. These curtains are beautiful.  The colors are vibrant and go well with the colors in my living room.  In order words, they look good! These looked nothing in reality like the image on the screen. They are so thin and the colors are so light that you\\'ll never see what you\\'re seeing on you\\'re screen. It\\'s not your monitor -- that\\'s clearly a doctored image. On the plus side the company gave me a full refund. But save yourself the trouble and just don\\'t buy this in the first place. these are awesome , LOVE THEM Awesome  very nice , heavy and quirky, but effective for doing a nautical theme. my daughter wanted this after seeing the one I got for my room and we both are very happy with them, even keeps sun out well Super cool. Way better than I expected them to be. I\\'m glad I read the reviews ahead and took my chances. So worth every penny. Beautiful! Love Material is like a shower curtain material.  My boys did not like it.  I took it back Really beautiful!  It actually didn\\'t quite work out for where i wanted to use these, but they were so pretty and nice I gave them to my daughter instead of sending them back.  Gorgeous. Very nice. Love colors. as described fast delivery highly recommended So much fun!!  I put this up in our computer room which is used sometimes for gaming.  Adds to the games. Great concept, good quality! The picture was not to defined Picture looks good  but,  panels are not the same length. Quite nice. Fit perfectly over my french doors beautiful, great quality, and it is exactly how the seller describes it. Also came within the shipling time they said too These are not made of real wood... tres beau !!! Awesome in playroom !Amazing colors! Cool I love these curtains so much! I bought these so I could cover the closet in my preschooler\\'s room after removing his closet doors. These are made of such thick, quality material and the sewing is excellent. I was pleasantly surprised by the feel of the material. Can\\'t brag on them enough. One curtain was enough to cover his double door closet. The color isn\\'t quite as dark as they pictured but is darker than my picture makes it look. (It\\'s a satiny feel so the sheen makes it hard to photograph the actual color) I\\'m thrilled with these! Came as seen gorgeous well packaged and worth the money Perfect It looks just like the picture. I am very happy with it. Love these drapes..a real room changer Parfait! Exactement ce à quoi je m\\'attendais! love them.........  brightens up my room.  shipping was fast.  curtains are thicker than I thought which is great. Went beyond my expectations! It has a 3-d  effect. Great deal at the price.  Looks like an expensive mural. Great material and they look really nice. The colors are beautiful. Silky, image was printed perfectly, panels were wide enough for our 71\" window without needing to find \"filler panels\". They don\\'t block light, though. We held them up to the room lights and could see light through them. It\\'s pretty but it doesn\\'t have a liner and the material itself is very light weight as well as almost sheer so when it heats up outside, the heat is felt through them and when the sun hits the window directly, it glares through. I would not buy this again. Because the curtain ruffles up/gathers it doesn\\'t look exactly like that. But it is cute. Curtains are out of alignment sewn wrong or screened wrong no more orders fer you These are cute. I thought it was weird that one fish us half on each curtain and the little school of red fish are kind of cheap looking. All in all, I would buy them again. It’s not what I was really expecting. They are not bright colors, like those in the image. Also the image does not look like 3D, unless you stay seeing it for 10 secs or more I have not used this yet but the material is very good, not thin at all. Looks good, not as much visual depth as expected. Party theme backing excellent The quality is really great!  Better than I thought Omg this so nice and Good product and quality I loved These are pretty. It is 3d looking if you leave it stretched out , however it is not exactly as distinctly 3d looking like the picture. Interestingly when I took picture it looks more 3d than it looks in person. My son loves it and that matters most :) These are really nice, just as shown, and work perfect for the beach house I hung them in - they did need a cool iron to get out the creases but after that they are hanging beautifully! The amazon picture is waaaaay nicer than what arrived.  Not high enough definition for \"3D\" pattern and lots of white spots. Returned with no issues. It is really colorful though. Looks great, not to dark lets some light in. Alot better looking than what I was expecting. They block the sun, but still let some light thru. Pretty pattern. 4 stars out of 5 because they don’t slide well on the curtain rod. Would be better if they had grommets. Beautiful. We use this as a closet door cover and got rid of the doors and it works perfectly and it’s beautiful Comforting to look at beautify the home. I like the curtains so far, the material looks good. Really good quality beautiful Nice This is a fun addition to my Christmas decor. I received many compliments on my living room. The fabric is substantial and the print gives the illusion of three dimensional decorations. I placed my tree in the center and it made my living room so festive.I put icicle lights in the window which added a great effect. I may order a different design for next year. These curtains are gorgeous! The print is a beautiful watercolor painting. The colors are bright and lovely. The curtains are a thick sateen feel with great stitching. Rod pocket top is extra deep and fit my thick curtain rod. These are just what I wanted floor to ceiling.  Needed to iron them as expected. Solid quality. Image not pixelated even though large size. Not too light nor too heavy for tension rod. This creates an imaginary view for the bedroom. It would be nice to have rings to hook thru the curtain rods though. Just easy to open and shut. I was do excited to order these as they looked so pretty, but when I got them I was a bit disappointed. First of all one side is shorter than the other like it wasn\\'t a straight cut. Second, the colors are so dull like a cheap quality printing therefore they just don\\'t look as vibrant as the pictures. For the price I paid I was expecting them to be extremely beautiful but they just didn\\'t have  that wow factor I was expecting. I love it, I\\'m thrilled. It does wrap around the curtain rod, which means when I open the curtains they get bunched up at the sides. If there were rings that alternated the curtain back and forth along the rod, I think that\\'d be better as it\\'d fold up nicely when opened. But as far as the curtain itself goes, I\\'m all sorts of happy and will probably consider some of their other designs for seasonal flavor. I was feeling a little guilty for this spendy purchase but it was totally worth it. I love Christmas decorating and this was the icing on the cake for my house. I received tons of compliments. Purchased these curtains as a gift. Really cute at their patio door during the holiday season. Great fun curtains, just not as perspectively convincing, but ok and measurements just as advertised. My son loves these!! A little more see through than the picture but they do block the light pretty well still. Love them Love it but too long to hang where I wanted to...will have to redesign. Me encanta como se ve . I like how this looks but it takes a steamer to get the wrinkles out while they are hanging.  Tried traditional iron to get them out but it made the colors fade. Me gusto mucho fun alternative window treatment. thin more like a shower curtain Good quality These curtains are well made and look amazing on my sliding doors. Really long need pleated at top. Amazing No me agrado para nada love this Beautiful.. Can\\'t wait to hang ot up. These are huge! Fantastic, very thick! Well worth the money love these Stunning fabrics. Yummy prints. I\\'m obsessed with this brand. I\\'m such a cheapskate, but nothing compares to their stuff. Seriously. The only thing is that I have to install grommets for my taste, but it\\'s no biggie. Keepem coming, guys!<br>Also pay attention to dimensions. They are the total for both panels. Most companies don\\'t do it that way cheap quality cloth-not worthy. It looks great. Material is a bit thin for harsh Florida sun, but other than that. Love the vibrant colors. I love it. In the daytime, when the sun is shining, the blue part glows a little like a real ocean scene would. Love these curtains! Great quality and even my critical husband (who hates everything I buy), loves them lol...so I call that a WIN! Beautiful in my living room with the xmas tree placed in the middle. Made for great picture taking. Very well made, loved the fabric Not quite what I expected I received the item on time and in good condition. The curtains are nice and the material is thick; not flimsy at all. Love it Silky material that is heavy.  The color is absolutely beautiful.  They complete my Christmas Living Room! The graphics were not as viberant as depicted. Misleading. Fabric quality was good. Construction was adequate. Everything looked great until we saw they come in a 2 1/2” pocket, not 4” which means it will be tougher to slide along the curtain rod! The perfect scenario is with grommets! Oh well, keep looking. These curtains have brought sunshine into my home.  It takes me back to the 70\"s every time I lay eyes on my curtains.  The curtains are a wonderful part of the soul for the time setting.  Thank You so much for this great idea it may be therapeutic to others. beautiful , perfect for privacy at night on kitchen sliders , matches our decor perfect, we love it These thick, privacy, satiny mural curtains look so gorgeous and realistic covering my French doors leading to my deck. I Love them! Beautiful great quality! I just love them!! very good... Perfect! When my 6 year old nephew came to visit for Thanksgiving and said, “Wow, that looks real! “, I knew I had a winner. Beautiful curtains at a great price. They are beautiful, colors are very vibrant! Looks nothing like the picture. Cheap looking curtain, faded colors, definitely not as vibrant as the picture portrays it. The fabric is a little cheap looking,  but I still love them. So pretty to look at and adds to the room. I liked the curtains, but it did not go with my bedspread. Good curtains. So beautiful and elegant. La combinacion de colores I was soo excited to find these, they go perfectly with my bedroom theme. Each panel is large enough to cover 1 of my windows so I only needed to purchase one set. They are, guess you can say a bit on the thin side. I folded them in half with double sided tape hoping it would help block more of the light. The window in the 1st picture shows a nice glow and the blinds are even closed. In my old curtains I used cardboard to help with the lighting. In the 2nd picture you can see darkened spots, that is the cardboard. I\\'m trying to decide if I like the brightness or if I want it darker. The 3rd picture is after dark. Overall I\\'m very happy with them. All I can say is WOW!!! absolutely phenomenal!!!!! Loved them The colors are realistic and vibrant making a great photo backdrop for any Italian themed event. Group some live potted plants in foreground and the look is professional. Very good buy. I really liked them.!!! Great price, works good for me. Thanks! beautiful - looks like my backyard. I love them. I should have ironed them in very low before hanging them up but the wrinkles are slowly coming out. I\\'m going to add to my original review. The vibrancy depicted online is technically accurate. While it does not appear as intense in person, when I took a picture, the picture looks intense as the online representation.<br><br>Original review:  The idea is a good one. Allows light in, which I was looking for. As far as imagining a beach scene, I have to work for it. Material is good. Privacy weight is good. I am keeping out of laziness - I don\\'t want to take them down, pack\\'em up, print the label and send them back, then search for a replacement. Seller, if the colors were more intense, you\\'d have a great product! Thank you to the company who delivered this so fast! You did what someone else could not. I am so pleased with the look, big old school images, and they look amazing! The length and width were perfect. I will never ever change these and I am pretty sure our guests will ask about them. Exactly what I expected and more. I bought 2 to use for closet “doors” in my 1860’s house, because traditional doors would have been quite pricey to have installed. Goes great with my rustic decor. Received this quickly &amp; packaged well. It\\'s very nice quality &amp; does block the sunlight well. The mauve is more of a purple/lilac. The colors are more subdued than the photos but it\\'s still very cool. I am returning it because the colors seriously clash with my decor but that\\'s the only reason. Absolutely love it! Couldn\\'t find anything close to it in the UK..has a somewhat shower curtain feel and picture isn\\'t the brightest but still... Just for being the only supplier to bring my idea  to life, I\\'m giving it 5 stars beautiful and just what I needed. Perfect for Christmas!  Makes the whole room!  True to size.  A thinner material.  I am a happy customer. This curtain completes my reading nook while giving me privacy from the street. Soothing to gaze upon. I just love these curtains.  Made well and look like picture. For me they are real nice for the price Looks like the photo 50% transparency. The curtains make the room feel like I\\'m at the beach.  The material is soft and sturdy.  I am so glad I bought them, they are unique and beautiful! We use this as a curtain in the bedroom so we had to have a second curtain behind it for more privacy. I would recommend this product to anyone. Just like the picture!! Beautiful curtains, good quality. They look beautiful in my daughter\\'s room The color is far from pic Looks awesome and completed my daughters basketball themed room. Thank you! looked cheap and was made of heavy material The curtians are like the photo, we love them! These are stunning, printed photographs on heavy weight polyester, extremely lifelike and realistic. The printed picture flows perfectly matched from one panel to the other. I live in a forest jungle and got these to cover a large closet, it\\'s like I added a large patio sliding glass wall! They are huge, 9 feet (really). The only thing I would advise is be sure you have 9 feet to hang them, or hang them separately in half the space. Because the polyester is heavy, they don\\'t gather well, or even slide on the rod i got very easily (that could be the rod and the way i had to hang them). Small price to pay for turning a middle bedroom wall into its own view of the jungle! Perfect as usual. Second time I purchased from here and the specs were true along with the blinds. These let in a lot of ambient light but are completely black out from the outside unless you shadow them. I live in a apartment and have live plants and these let in good light for indoor plants while keeping privacy. These are beautiful and fun! We put them in our living room and they are bright. I am going to order another set because I want four panels on the window instead of two so that it looks fuller. I think I also might buy those curtain lights that I saw from amazon too and put them with it. Will be a great effect together! Certainly worth adding to your home! Love it! And got it overnight without paying some crazy shipping price!! Did not look like the photo at all.  The picture looked like soft colors.  In actually, the coloring was too strong.  Other buyer might love it but just not me.  I gave it to the Goodwill. Really nice curtains....adds a unique flair to my daughters bedroom which is currently decorated in Paris decor.<br>The material looks expensive and of high quality. No complaints with these. My son loves them and everyone who walks into his room is awe struck by them! Very vibrant and not cheaply made. Love them. Thank you! I’m very pleased. I had an ugly wall outside my kitchen door.  Now it looks amazing with a view that looks realistic! Love the quality. Great picture..<br>Exactly what I wanted. Perfect measurements. Pic looked 3-d to me. It was flat print with not much color to make it pop These are the most awesome and beautiful curtains I have ever owned, good quality beautiful Looks great as the \"door\" to my son\\'s room. Very happy with this purchase. Print was really large, not what I was looking for! Very thin material Absolutely love it....goes great with my decor LOVE IT Looks great Nice curtains! Very happy with purchase. Timely shipping. Item is just as described. Thank you We bought these curtains for our toddler, who loves looking at the moon. It’s a little difficult to position them closed so that the moon halves meet up, but the picture is high-quality. I really did not like the fabric on this curtain- it looked really cheap and shiny. Not at all what I pictured when ordering a \"Japanese Style\" curtain. It looks so much prettier and more appealing online then it did in person, once I saw it I knew quickly that I would return it. Bought these for my new beach cottage. Looks like we’re still viewing the ocean at night when we close them! Love them! They are as described and beautiful! Got tons of compliments and made the place festive Hermosas cortinas de tela satinada y colores vivos  Loved them..what a bargain. ..sister wants some! Sewings are just ok, kind of twisted, and make the fabric wrinkled, color printing not so good, cheap quality. Quality is ok, one of the animals is missing an eye. Looks great. I love the Moon it’s a shame this curtain cuts it’s in half  I wish I would have ordered Full Moon and Foggy Clouds with Turquoise Glass Like Sea Ocean Print, make sure you look where the curtain opens  just saying I love my curtains!  I set in my room and look at the moon and image I\\'m on a cruise down the French Riviera and my troubles of the day just melt away.  They are at it\\'s prettiest when the sun shines through them and the moon looks like it\\'s really glowing! Well the material is good but the actual picture isn\\'t as vibrant and solid as it appears in photo on Amazon.  Once put up and light is behind It, it is faded alot. I felt like sending it back honestly. Disappointed. These look so cool in person. I love them! The pic is in a dark room. They do not block a ton of light but I didn\\'t want them to. Generous size to ensure the entire window is covered.  Great light filtering shade (not blackout) and the colors are true to the picture.  Love it! I love it, good quality. Use for my spa room Cheap very thin material, poorly made, way over priced. More like shower curtains. Design is the only reason I’m keeping them but will not be buying any more. These curtains were just what I was looking for. I use them on my laundry room door opening. They go very well with my log cabin theme. These curtains look wonderful in my son’s room, and with the light coming through behind them, it actually looks like sunlight filtering between trees! Expensive but worth the price the material is a very high quality....also thick so blocks the sun out and keeps room warm and comfy ....perfect for a basketball obsessed fan Very thin see through not what I expected Looks nice I like it a lot.  Good quality. Very disappointed in the white spots in the mountain scenes which had no colorations conforming with mountains and actually found them through out the curtains Beautiful We all love this fabric and display of player. colors did not seem to match Gave me two of the same side. No basketball hoop and color was not vibrant Perfect!! Material was thicker than expected, and looks wonderful for my Christmas display Im very happy with these curtains. Worked well where I needed them to be. Love the curtains, as soon as I open them I see the lake I live by. as it was meant to be.... Good item Vintage, so very different . I love this. So amazing and was as expected. Only if bigger sizes were available.<br>All my friends found it spectacularly awesome. I received but got the same panels.  They do not go together.  I didn\\'t get the one with the goal in it. Lovely curtains : fab printing Beautiful! Great for a football themed room. A little pricy but my son likes them! These are absolutely beautiful! Hung on our French doors behind the Christmas tree. Thick, soft durable material It does not look like the picture. The fabric is nice, however the hues are not vibrant, and the gold looks more orange. Love this picture and it was great for pictures they got hung up on the wall to big These \"scenery\" curtains can be a fine line between art or disaster, soothing or disturbing. But this nature scene is lovely in natural tones, and a lovely way to add art to an entire wall and make a statement. This was for a mans room, a man who loves nature. It is perfect. This window faces west and as the sun descends it hits the \"pier\" image and looks even more real. Measure your space carefully and choose wisely. We added botanical prints to the other walls to keep the Nature Theme for this room It is soothing and lovely. panels do not match and one is shorter than the other by 5 inches.......I want a new set and to return the first pair with the refund credited to the new panels.  second message have heard nothing from Ambesonne. When I ordered this curtain,I thought maybe the price was a bit high, but I had to have it. I was more than happy when I opened the package. The curtain is heavy and feels substantial. The colors are exactly as they appear in the listing. These curtains are great! I\\'ll be ordering 2 more sets.  Way better quality than I thought  they would be.  Perfect for what I needed them for. I bought these curtains to add christmas feeling in my house and they definitely did. I had to stitch them onto the heavy curtains I have, because they are thin( made it cold inside) but so worth buying Every room in my home has some representation of Brooklyn, and what better for the guest bedroom!  These look exactly as pictured, and with a night light on there\\'s some kind of optic illusion that\\'s great. Good quality, very nice thick silky fabric. The pattern wasn\\'t what I expected, so I returned them. I was looking for a smaller tighter pattern. These were too \"cartoonish\". We used these curtains as a backdrop for my 40th birthday party. It was a masquerade ball. Everyone loved it! If it is made before it is sent should have more choices of size Made an awesome closet door for our bedroom! This is pretty, but not of fabric.  It\\'s like a shower curtain material. Love, beautiful These are the coolest curtains ever! These curtains are so well made and beautiful. The fabric feels silky but they\\'re thick. So happy with them! the colors are not as vibrant as I expected.. but it\\'s still pretty! We got this for my 7 year old sons room. We re did it in a sports theme and it looks awesome. Nice material and color. Love them, look great and certainly enhances the window/room. In real life, the scenery looks more artificial. Exactly how is shows in the picture they are heavy duty and nice thick material I have had mine on my sliding glass door for a year now and they have sun light on them all the time and there is no fading or discoloration they look the exact same as when I took them out of the package.The colors are bright looks like if you were standing and looking at the seen in real life so glad I bought this I like that the city scene is faded which makes it appear as if it is in the distance.  The black bold lines that are to represent the window panes are faded. Not jet black as I expected it to be. VERY DISAPPOINTING! I couldn’t use them as planned and took away from the room theme I had planned. Took them down immediately. They looked as if they had been washed. Disappointed Amazon Really like these curtains, not flimsy, thick, do not let sun in n look really nice on my patio doors, will definitely buy again The curtains are exactly as pictured.  They have a good weight without being too heavy.  They really do make a perfect backdrop for pictures or your Christmas tree. These curtains work great as a backdrop for a party. Better than hanging wrapping paper on wall. Very thick fabric. Keeps out the cold and looks so pretty. This curtains are very good looking,and also it makes the room more relaxing.<br>This curtains are Perfect!<br>Estela D. Curtains worked well for the Star Wars theme for my grandson’s room. These curtains really make the room 50% transparency Amazing,  these curtains are better than I expected.  The material is great, best curtains I\\'ve purchased by far.  I love that they came in a long width size. are much more pastel that the picture would indicate.  Still interesting, but not bright enough for the room I was going to use them Love it a joy to see when you walk in. Kinda thin but still gets the job done✅ loved it Defective, not sewn right! These curtains are SO MUCH fun!  It makes me smile every time I look at them.  At night, they look cool from the outside of the house, too.  I\\'m sure the neighbors wonder where in the world I got such a crazy wonderful curtain set. Love it.<br>We have a HUGE workshop/garage space that we fixed up. I wanted something industrial-ish to close off the ‘garage’ area from the game room area. Very happy with how it turned out! The fabric has two layers, the front is as shown and the back is white. I personally think it’s a solid, thick and heavy material. I may buy another for a different opening, ha. We remodeled my daughter\\'s room we had this huge blank wall we didn\\'t know what to do with so we hung up this curtain it is so freaking cool she loves it! Good product,nice heavy material, the 108 width wasnt 108 \" come up about 3-4 inches short so had to hang panels at each end The light comes through and shows all the colors! really impressed by the quality and it looks really beautiful with the effects definitely will recommended I always buy Ambesonne curtains! I believe I have 5-6 of them now and everyone always comments on how beautiful they are. Zebras to low beautiful material the best i love these curtains They just dont hold out the light The colors are pretty, there\\'s no doubt about that. I had higher hopes, but I got exactly what I expected. On Amazon, this looks like a photo of a forest, but in real life, it\\'s a little washed out and looks a bit more like a painting. My application was to cover an ugly area just off my kitchen where the washer and dryer are. I\\'m still not sure how I feel about it. The fabric is nice.<br><br>Update:<br>I wasn’t sure how I felt about it. Well, after two weeks, I really like it. Love Them I want these for every room in my home, just fantastic. Bought this item for a Christmas present. Very disappointed. Does not look like the item pictured. Cheep material and dull in color. Would not recommend to anyone. This company should be ashamed. On my monitor this looks red.  No. It\\'s orange with a lot of green.  Miami colors. I\\'m FSU. Can\\'t use it Fun -- They feel and look a little like those fabric shower curtains, but the size is great.  I bought the dark colors and they look super on the end of my screen porch, where I need privacy from neighbors. Shower curtain These curtains were purchased to match my forest tapestries and they were exactly what I was looking for! The level of quality for these matches perfectly with the tapestries! This is a must buy item!<br><br>-Cheema Fell in love with these!! Beautiful! Looks pretty cool. Of course the picture is a lot better than the actual curtain. High quality curtain, beautiful image. Love the colors.  They fit perfect. The drapes are made of a very durable fabric.  I installed them using a draw rod and installed drapery hooks in the back. Very pretty in person. These block very little light but otherwise they are beautiful and look the same as online These look beautiful in my bedroom. The colors are vibrant and the picture is very detailed. Very relaxing to look at. Many people thought it was my actual view. Adds action to any room The right side curtain seem to be faded but overall they look very nice Excellent product love it Absolutely love these curtains, they look awesome from outside also! Very pleased with the coloring and the high quality of the material was easy to machine wash . Color wasn\\'t as expected. Beautiful.. love this got for my bedroom. Looks like a picture. Heavy material.made nice. Will be buying more. very nice ordering another pair soon Light shines through the curtains, though. Get lots of complements on this. Wish it was slightly heavier for insulation, but still keeps cold out nicely with a little light coming in I wanted these forever. Finally splurged. Wish I had not waited. So beautiful to look out &amp; imagine myself at the beach. These were exactly what I was looking for! The colors are great and the measurements are accurate. I used the free shipping option and they arrived in 4 days. It\\'s a cloth with nice prints Just as described and offers plenty of privacy. Super fun and vibrant colors with nice material. It ok but doesn’t look as good as pictured. Was what it said it was and was shipped fast very pretty Looks better online I ordered \"Old Sail Boat in The Ocean on White Background Pirate Treasure Retro Illustration\" 108*84. The one that I saw on the website has some creases on the upper sides. However, the curtain that I got is stiff and did not have any creases when I hung it on a curtain rod. It rather looks a kind of shower curtain. In fact, I bought this with $29.99 while other similar products\\' price around $65. I thought it was a discount, but now I think this is the reason that I got the product that somewhat looks cheaper and tacky. My husband was in charge of decorating the TV room, and picked these curtains. The whole family loves them! They are so cool! This is our second set of designer curtians from this company, great quality and concepts. Absolutely beautiful, exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely recommend it. I’m very conservative and was very concerned about the looks of the drapes. I’m happily to say that my concerns were wrong, the design, or perhaps the colors match perfectly the environment that I was trying to cover. Good quality. Awesome of the East Side Highway of Manhattan. Covers the entire extra wide sliding door. Arrived pretty quickly. These are not room darkening but not sheer either. Pattern is great for my family room and my other retro items. Print is large. They are polyester but not much sheen. I use them as photo op backdrops at our church events! The fabric was very nice but the colors were not as vibrant as it is in the picture Super nice VERY HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY AND COLORS PERFECT SIZE so much more stunning and substantial than it appears in the photo<br>really nice quality and surprisingly beautiful.  A great bargain.  So glad I found this. very cute My son loves them but rhey are way to long. Gitta take them to be taken up. Beautiful I bought this for my girlfriend\\'s mom for her Christmas present.  It got here in a day in the remodeled guest bedroom called the Paris room I installed these panels in my dining room and they are absolutely elegant.  The fabric and quality of product is great. Look great in living room Item came stained and was advertised as brand new These curtains are so beautiful I put them in my dining room and they go well with my setting I love them. Just beautiful and elegant. They are exactly what I wanted I couldn\\'t be happier! Look SO good with my Coral Walls!!! This particular print looks nothing like the picture. It is stretched and skewed. I really wanted to like it but the material feels cheap and it\\'s just ugly. I returned it. So cute and very high quality. They look even better in person! Used for a pineapple/Hawaiian baby nursery! Beautiful it looks great a good update fo kids play room Oh so beautiful, even nicer in person. Thank You Thanks ! Fabric is like a printed polyester, and it lets a little light through which I prefer. It is pretty great value for what you get! I wish it was a little darker/ bolder in color otherwise i love it. Feels more like a shower curtain then window curtains. (The material) <br><br>With so much selection available in this category, I took a chance on this image. It\\'s better looking than pictured and the middle lines up even when closed. The Sun light comes through in the AM... it amplifies the colors and really makes a great impression. It\\'s really nice! More than happy.<br>Thank you Looks great, high quality, keeps light out. Definitely recommend if you\\'re a true American! Very pretty - heavy weight curtain. They are durable and fit well as a decoration for our dojo. It works as the one of the final touches in my oriental room! This is the coolest set of curtains. Everyone that has seen these loves them. They were the perfect curtains for my log cabin. Very good quality and the colors are vibrant! Very pleased with this purchase! SCREEN PRINT ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS, THINK THEY MAY BE A LITTLE TO LONG, I HAVE NOT HUNG THEM UP YET I love these curtains! I used them in my spare bedroom, which is a fun &amp; whimsical decor, so these were perfect. The quality of the picture is very nice and the material is soft and satiny, but not sheer. I wish I had more places in my house to hang more curtains like this in different designs. They are all so cool and I get a lot of compliments when people visit. No one has what we have! It\\'s different, the artist is magnificent, light shines thru and the drape\\'s scenery comes alive. Changes with light at night. They are so thick and well made, I\\'m hoping they will last for a long time, I\\'m glad I invested...nothing like these in stores!! These are made well and slightly heavy.  They let light through but I think that makes them more attractive.  I would purchase from this seller again.  They have a lot of patterns too, it was hard to choose one. I love it...even with the wrinkles, which I will steam out later. It makes my puppies room look like an island paradise . The printed image on the curtains is poor quality and appears as though the image was “stretched” too large. The end result is a grainy, pixelated-looking flag. The material is a nice weight, but has a shiny, oily sheen to it. It’s reminiscent of a shower liner. The picture is nothing like what I ordered, along with poor graphics. I ordered a Lakeview with trees, and got a marsh with a commercial building off to the side. Nothing like what I ordered! Looks nice but material is way lighter than the one in the picture. Love the colors and quality, however the seam at the top was loose when I received it and quickly became unraveled. The seam in only held together by a couple strands. Again, nice curtain, but now one side hangs way down from the rod. Expected a bit better quality for the price. I really like these curtains except that they do not reach the floor evenly. So beautiful when the sun shines through at dusk and dawn. Curtains we as advertised good quality the material is nice and soft it has a backing on it, the colors are beautiful, better than in the picture. Thank you very much for a quality product at a fair price. The picture was exactly what I expected, but I was disappointed in the material. It was very cheap looking polyester and while I wasn\\'t expecting them to keep out too much light, it was no better than having nothing in my windows at all. Great we loved them. looks like you can step right into the water. I will be buying more Great These are absolutely perfect in our craft room. My daughters love them! They look beautiful on my windows. Colors are great, love the fabric! This is so much fun. These curtains are exactly what I\\'m looking for!  Fast shipping item as promised will be back again!! On the pricey side, but oh, so worth it. Sunsets on the beach are a favorite of mine, and I can now enjoy via these curtains at night. I often have my door open during the day, and they have held up well with the incoming breeze and make a satisfying flap sound. I am so happy with these that soon I am going to replace a perfectly good pair of plain white curtains upstairs with a daytime picture of the beach to please me when I wake up. We bought 3 sets. 2 for our very wide window/doors and one for our normal 6’ wide window/door! They go beautifully with our Aviation themed home. We didn’t use the pocket for rods. We used clipped on rings so we could hang them on really nice updated rods!! These are the second pair of curtains I have ordered from this company. I absolutely love the different designs they offer. The light filters through perfectly and they are even more beautiful in person. I have received so many compliments on both pairs that many of my friends have gotten some from this company LOVE!! Is a thick odd fabric but not in a bad way.<br>Looks like a nice piece of art work on the wall. Beautiful and it does a good job of filtering out the sunlight!  It looks longer in the picture, but it was long enough to do the job! MY DAUGHTER BEDROOM  DESIGN CUTENESS NOT DURABILITY.  GOOD VALUE I have these hanging in my nail room at the salon for ambiance. They were hung using heavy duty Velcro and look great! Dpes not look anything like the picture. Looks good Just reiterating that these curtains are not very thick, while they’re very pretty and perfect size for my large sliding glass doors! The pictures on here dont do these curtains justice. They were better then i could have dreamed of for my daughters room. The images on the curtains are big and bold. Best purchase ever. So worth the price. They are big and long. I bought 1 set which fits 2 windows perfectly. They are not cheaply made either. Really good quality. Seriously i am taking the time to write this review because they are that awesome. My daughter was amazed and loves them. They give her room that extra oooo. Love this curtain! We have a nautical theme bedroom and this fits perfectly! Good quality material and the picture is quite clear as well. Way better than I expected actually. The BEST!  High quality. I could not have asked for a better curtain.  Be careful it stains easily even water stains. Love the coffee theme.!! Love the colors.<br> The curtains are quite thin. I bought a pair of solid brown dark out curtains to go behind them. We got this to separate a large closet from our main room and were very happy with the purchase. Being indecisive, we\\'re apparently going for the bohemian/old english/rustic/fancy look and this fits all of them. Very high quality feeling and looking panels! Makes me feel like I\\'m on vacation!  Nice weight to it as well. They are beautiful and fit perfectly in my teenager’s bedroom.  bright, bold printing on heavy weight material - satisfied! Great curtain I love the quality it is just as described!!! I love the curtains! They look beautiful in my kitchen, material quality is great! I would order from this company again! Print is faded - not clear like shown in picture of product. Not as perfect as in the picture curtain looks faded Lined and beautiful Its perfect!!!! I highly recommend these curtains. Great quality❤ Thanks for this item  It has been a LOOOOOONG winter in Ohio, and we\\'ve enjoyed these curtains every day! Actually I nice curtain weight, and they hang nicely. Unfortunately, the image is very pale.  It\\'s not at all vivid like the picture. As with many of the printed curtains, there was too much light bleeding through in the middle of the day.  I sewed a layer of black linen onto the back of the curtain to make it block more light.  The construction of the curtain was good, and the picture was vibrant and realistic. A little out of focus but still really nice. I\\'m keeping it! I just have to reset my rod a little higher and farther apart so that the curtains sit well against the window This is the sort of thing you might buy and then wonder why you bought it. Very pretty curtain, we used it to cover a large window in our bedroom that we never open. Durning the day the light shines through a little brightening it up, and making it look like we are on a island somewhere. It has made our bedroom very beautiful! Love it the look is so real it brought the room looking so nice in my bedroom The pictures were not clear Good quality. Fast shipping. Looks great and my Lego obsessed 12 year old loves them. Great image and colors! Thick, double lined, white on reverse side. Nice length, floor to bottom of tub. Affordable beautiful quality. This curtain panel is beautiful in my bedroom. It matches my bed covers and decorative items. It fitted perfectly in width and length. It is one of a kind which I enjoyed the minute it was hung. I would have gave it 5 stars if it came in a shorter length.<br>Otherwise, it is perfect! Exactly as expected, we love it! Lovely colors. During the day there\\'s enough light that comes through to keep the room bright without having direct sun. At night, we also use a dark, lightweight shower curtain for complete room-darkening and restful sleep. Photo shows how it looks with and without the shower curtain as a liner. Loved the idea. Color (black) saturation is not good. Looks more like a dark gray or very faded black. For the price, it\\'s going back. FYI this is definitely a kid\\'s, dorm, or younger room. I was looking for curtains in the master bath - looks juvenile. This is a cool curtain set but the flowers are dark pink with a distinctly feminine vibe. Not fitting for the masculine room we were decorating. I would be confident in purchasing the curtain for quality though, it seemed very nice and was packaged well. The quality was amazing. I didn’t keep due to ordering wrong size and girlfriend not liking but I’d highly recommend vendor for high quAlity. I\\'m in love! Exactly as advertised, perfect length &amp; arrived timely! They were beautiful but to sheer for what I needed. It was very good quality cloth also the image is crispy and clean. Love it I like the fact that I was able to find a unique and different style Curtain with an amazing print..  Thanks Amazon Great quality! Looks and feels amazing!!! BUENA CALIDAD, EXCELENTE MATERIAL, FACILES DE LAVAR, ENTREGA OPORTUNA Love these curtains. Needed that added touch to<br>dining area and these did the job!! The comforter was exactly what I wanted! Love this one , looks great and beautiful in my home Unwuiness I was looking for something that would add to my room and bring the outdoors inside. I love the color and the fact that it lets in enough light without having them open.  Also the lining makes it so people can\\'t see inside like some curtains do. Every happy with my purchase. I love how the curtains look from the outside, too! I love Love Love these curtains and everyone that enters my house also loves them. I\\'m sure that a few of my friends will be ordering a pair soon.<br>little pricey, but worth it. My daughter really loves it doesn’t look like the picture I LIKE DIFFERENT DRAPES THIS SURE IS<br><br>LOVE IT Not what I expected. Way to shirt for a sliding glass door and the color is a bit off. Wish the material was better feels like cheap hard curtains. They are ok great for space theme room but material is stiff. These beautiful mural curtains fit beautiful across my French doors in my kitchen addition, which is for family eating and gathering for fun. They are very thick, non see through and have a satin finish. I alternate between these and another set I bought at the same time. Beautiful in my sons space room These worked out great as room dividers, just as described and vibrant dark colors Nice look to them, but very thin and light comes through.  My daughter loves them though.  I feel the quality does not match the price. These are beautiful, add charter to living room.  They are thick, not flimsy blocks enough light. Very very pretty I am very impressed with the quality of these curtains. I\\'m using them in my wedding and will use them after. Goes perfect, love it Great product I love this product!!! Seems like my bedroom is cooler. Was a different pattern than the photo Nice Very nice!!!! These are really beautiful and well made. They definitely darken the room and the little light that comes through bathes the room in blue. Which didn\\'t work for me so I have to return them. My son loves these curtains. I bought these to block out some of the sunlight that is making his room so hot. I know that these are not blackout curtains, but anything will help to make his room feel cooler. And contrary to what the Q&amp;A respnse says above, these DO fit a 3\" wide flat curtain header. Quality control a small issue. Length varies an inch. i have the same view during the day, when curtains are open,<br> now i can enjoy after dark, its just great for real - old man mike bengyak They are not quite as richly colored, or as blue at the top as pictured, They are more pink and purple. But still nice. Lovey decor I put lights in the back and made the flowers on it come alive. Daughter loves it.  Color not as vibrant as the picture still nice. Granddaughter loves everything galaxy... Very beautiful. Is at least 6 1/2 feet long. Greatest buy Very happy with this purchase Product as described very good service. We got these yesterday and put them up immediately. We LOVE them. What a great addition to our holiday decor.  You will not be disappointed.  They\\'re beautiful, durable and light up the room. Thermal for sure. I use these in a doorway of a room within a room made of unframed, taped together walls and ceiling of insulating wallboard. It is inside an unventilated garage in hot sunny CA! It is unbearable to be in that garage. BUT, we put a little room a/c inside and the room is frigid in minutes and stays cool even right up by the curtains. PLUS they are sharp, pretty and full of ambiance. the cat, serendipitously looks JUST like the beloved cat of the man for whom the room was built. It houses a sofa and all of his books! The gothic window and books were a perfect image. The prices was reasonable and I am just delighted with the product. Well made, strong, pretty, functional. I will buy other images of these sometime for other rooms. The curtains look great in my daughter\\'s room.  Although they aren\\'t blackout curtains, they are thick enough to keep it plenty dark. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because they don\\'t hang straight down, they are so thick they flare out a little. Although I ironed and steamed them, I still had to tack them on the bottom to straighten them out.  That said, I would definitely recommend these. My daughter loves them in her beach themed room! Wow these curtains exceeded my expectations.  Really amazing  graphic and excellent quality... they are a great deal for the price. My son loves dinosaurs and he is in love with these curtains.. they seemed huge but they were perfect! I love these but one is a lighter color than the other so they do not match.  How can I talk to someone about it? Great for the holidays! I love it! I will update with a picture soon!  the dimensions were 99% accurate. I bought the 108 x 84  to cover a large wall and it is amazing to see. Definitely a fantastic focal point. Thank you! Great product. Great colors! Perfect size. Excellent shipping. Worth the price. Very nice scene adds a nice touch to our living room. Picture doesn\\'t show the obvious stitches in actual product. Beautiful but needs pleated at top. Long. They are ok. Thick enough and exactly as pictured other than the greens are not as vibrant or dark as shown Nice Beautiful love them That is a beautiful and suggested curten design  made on a first quality silky fabric which I enjoy in my dining room.<br><br>Norma from Miami FL This is the first time I have ignored reviewers and bought an item despite the 1 star rating it had. I am soooo glad I did! It wasn\\'t the beautiful curtains fault that humans don\\'t measure before buying and/or pay attention to the size.<br><br>I should note that they do not completely block out light and would not classify them as \"black out\" curtains but they are certainly made well enough to not have any privacy concerns in my bedroom. And the light that does directly shine on them is diffused enough to make the scenery come all the more to life, while at the same time blocking the light enough to where I can still sleep if I desire. Perfect and beautiful.<br><br>Measure twice, order once... and order the size your window or door needs as size DOES matter. This comes with two panels so that they gather nice. The backside of the drapes is plain white so it conforms to my HOA rules &amp; it\\'s thick enough to give plenty of privacy but thin enough to let ambient light through. My window is too small for both panels which is fine because it lends to creating the look I wanted. I have it hung flush to the wall behind a set of blackout drapes. Now when I open the blackout drapes, it looks like I have a nice view of the ocean. I\\'ve always wanted a room with a view. When I lie on my bed and look towards the window, the sensation of relaxation that this landscape transmits to me is incredible. At dawn the landscape becomes illuminated as if it were really dawning on the beach, and at sunset the same thing happens, you feel that you are really on the beach watching the sunset. The quality is very good and the colors perfect. It is one of the best purchases of my life. Originally, I bought it for my daughter\\'s room and ended up being mine, just mine. I would definitely rave about these curtains! They are sturdy but allow some filtered light through which is what I wanted. They are well constructed with nice seams and beautiful graphics. They are unique and add a touch of the outdoors to my rustic cabin. I absolutely love them! They are exactly as pictured. Love them!!!! Curtains look great! Gives my room that peaceful/beachy feeling I was looking for! Only thing is I have to iron them since they are wrinkly from the packaging, but clearly I skipped that part! Wrinkles give character lol These curtains frame my Christmas tree and add a whole new look. They are beautifully made, colors are vivid, silky, the right curtains to make the holidays merrier Awesome love it Gorgeous. Amazing quality material delivered promptly. Makes my office window wonderful. Loved the design just wish they came in shorter lengths. Looks great just what I hoped for Love it! Looks exactly like pictured! Very Nice for my house Was actually too long for my French doors but is a really pretty curtain absolutely beautiful. they are fantastic. if i could do every wall in my bedroom with a full wrap around scene i would do it in a heart beat. just love them. let me know if such a thing exists. wrap around scene from the ones i already got. i will buy them. thanx, paul. Feels  like I\\'m at my hunting cabin. Love the curtains perfect match!! The drapes are beautiful and I love them! We have a cat room in our house (that use to be an office) so I had to cover some really ugly doors.  I couldn\\'t think of a better way until I came across these curtains, it made the room SO CUTE. Love them but had to get two sets so it would look good.  I have a sliding glass doors that I wanted covered.  One set covered it but had no gathering like they should be.  So I got a second set.  It looks so much better. They’re prettier in the picture than online. The fabric was heavy, thick, and shiny, rather than thin and airy like it looks in the picture. Overall, I didn’t like the look of the fabric even though the patter was beautiful. Just what I was looking for!!  They are perfect. They arrived quickly and are nice but do not look exactly like the picture.  The picture is vibrant and  very detailed. My curtains I can\\'t find the setting sun.  Colors and picture doesn\\'t stand out in detail like the one in the picture description. Great looking curtins. These curtains are beautiful.  They are silky to the touch. Very, very nice heavy drape My class used this as a back drop for a circus presentation. First the negative...I\\'ve had friends ask me if I turned a shower curtain into a window curtain.  The material is shower curtain material. The material also has the sewing lines still pre stamped right on the back of the material, which you can see from outside.  Very easily and cheaply made and way over priced.  Positive....They hang nicely and the print is crisp and clear. The design of the print comes together perfectly in the middle of the two panels.The wrinkles fell out over time from being folded. I love the uniqueness of having a landscape curtain rather than the simple traditional lace or cotton print design or solid color.  Sometimes we have to pay a bit more for whimsical unique ideas.  I have bought three pairs of different designs so far.  Nothing is perfect! After I hung up both pieces, it lined up perfectly, just like the picture.  I have gotten things that wouldn\\'t line up because of shoddy manufacturing but this was exact. Feels like a shower curtain.  The image is okay. Beautiful and good quality. Wash &amp; dry well, too. Definitely great for adding color/theme to a room. A lot shinier than I expected, which makes them look on the cheap side..or like I tried to use a shower curtain instead of drapes. Didn\\'t like the way they looked at all. Mostly my bad decorating decision. Guess I\\'ll try to sell them on my own. The are pretty funky if you have the right place to put them. They are a lot lighter once they\\'re on the rod with light behind them. If you want the deep plum as shown, I suggest you get a liner. A lot bigger than I expected but made an amazing room divider, the fabric is amazing! I love it I have attempted to purchase this twice. Both times the right panel has the same defect. It looks like the printer got jammed and kept printing the same thing all the way down to the bottom. How someone even proceeded to sew the pocket and edges is beyond me. Unless it\\'s all robots now. I have no idea, but I\\'m hoping I can get a set that is complete.  I\\'m giving 2 stars because 1 panel is ok.  I\\'ll update if I can get a complete set. These were not what I expected. They looked like they might be heavy duty but they ended up looking like something out of a cheap 70’s motel. Light colors, not as defined as the pics beautiful, nice material The colors are not as bright as in pocture, but using it anyways My Grandson loved the curtains I gave him for his birthday. I got them in the mail faster than I though it would take to get them. We are happy with the curtains. I love the design a quote. Matches my sons room perfectly. Love the curtains! Quick delivery. Quality product. Beautiful and seem to be excellent quality, I find the be moderately thicker than most curtains and seem more durable.<br><br>However, I have never had to wash these, I do not know how they hold up if needed washing. I\\'m sure the best route would be to dry clean but again, I do not know how the curtains would be after the washing and steaming. All thought a when buying. However for quality on first unboxing and hanging. I believe them to be beautiful and a heavier duty curtain than most. These just arrived today. Our son loved these curtains for his ocean theme bedroom. Included a picture of them on a cloudy day with the blinds closed behind them. Excited to see what they look like when the sun is shining! Im very pleased with the curtains. They\\'re what I was looking for my window. so easy to put up.  It won\\'t fall down..  easy to clean looks great! Goes good in my front room These curtains really brightens up a drab room Material is ok, not consistent, but the nail in the coffin for these drapes were the color... definitely not grey, more blue than grey.. fyi, my walls are grey so they stuck out like a sore thumb :/ Vivid and natural colors,  superb quality fabric and stitching.  I used them as a room divider in a studio to separate the kitchen area, which  enlarged and brightened the space. Perfect way to redecorate any room on a dime! I do like the curtains and the picture is nice. Just feels a little bulky but overall happy with the purchase. The image is cheap and not as sharp as the picture. Really not worth the money. Returned it the moment I opened the package. Dragon is fierce and the colors are great. They are much lighter than the pictures but it still looks great. Will definitely buy another with a different design. Amazing backdrop to our GoT Iron Throne! I love my new curtains. Simply beautiful. The arrived a day earlier than expected. Way to go Amazon! I Love it!  Looks Great Good quality! Vivid. Well made and nice material Beautiful!! I am ordering another set today :) These are the finishing touch on my Moroccan lanai and they are perfect.  The fabric drapes beautifully.  The image is exactly as pictured.  I love them Super-fast shipping! Great Seller.  :-)  These curtains are totally non-see-through! Not worth the money I am in love with my new curtains!! Looks so much better in person. I honestly wish I would have just purchased two of the single panel ones. I got this one and a single panel for what I needed it for, the single panel is great but this is the same image of the single panel but stretched out over two. Based on the design, it would have looked totally normal if I had two of the single panels hanging next to eachother. But this set of two panels with one stretched image does NOT look normal. For the price I am very disappointed. I\\'d been eyeing these for months and had finally talked myself into buying them. Also they are very white on the other side rather than showing through brown. So beautiful! Used them to hide our trash bins that are in a nook outside in a common area... Looks amazing. These are amazing. So well made. Unfortunately had to return. These are for a patio door in a huge room  Ordered, delivered, happy! Nothing to complain about here these are so pretty next to light grey walls and twinkle lights behind them Bought as a backdrop for my daughter\\'s medieval themed wedding. Great print and the quality was a bonus. Love them! Guest feel they are at the beach Fits the room great! Do not buy this.. they will not except returns. Excellent  quality  print with vivid colors, high density  wrinkle resistant fabric. Curtains enlarge and brighten small space. Highly recommend! Loved the curtains takes up the whole back wall in my workout room This is the curtains that have a missing color spit which is very vusake SO pretty! thank you! Ppperrrrrr fect. Love love love fhank you for designing this. It looks just like the picture. Great quality and everything. I hung this in a doorway and loved it. I covered the entire oversized doorway with one curtain Looks great and exactly what it is represented to be. Material too thick!!! Like choir robs. Okay so, I\\'m a broke MFer. I buy clothes and household goods by the pound at Dig n Save, buying $65 curtains is NOT how I roll. However, these curtains remind me of my favorite place on Earth so I took a plunge, and received at least $20 worth of happiness just by hanging them! I received at least $3 of happiness waking up to them! I think they are going to earn their keep quickly. Bonus, the setting looks real with the sun coming through the windows behind them. fun curtains to make a view where there is none, nice weight material with vivid colors Love these curtains, the sun shines through my patio doors in the morning, and when the curtains are closed it lights up the waterfall for a more picturesque room. Perfect for my patio sliding door.  Also looks very nice from the outside at night the design is visible. way too long  color and quality not good in person love them Very happy with this purchase. I had waited about 4 months before I gathered the courage and money to purchase them. I love that they atr NOT sheer, the large size and that they are pastel colors.<br><br>I took 1 star off because I wish it was a little more detailed. But over all I\\'m very happy.<br><br>I didn\\'t put these on a rod. I just tacked them up over my closet. The closet doors were too heavy and hurting my arms so I found these curtains instead.<br><br>I did iron them before I put them up. Much to light to see the picture very plane. Bought To others pares with different seans and loved them. Will still be ordering more in the future. Love them. They can totally black out the room in daylight hours with a cool back light effect.  We use them for night time at home as we have blinds and we like to roll casual. The design is so cool. They look just like the picture- Makes our room look great! I would buy them again I love them that much!! I bought the african sunset and it looks great in my living room. I have a large window and the curtains do a great job at covering the whole window as well as keeping out sunlight because near sundown the sun is shining directly in my living room for about 2 hours which used to make it hot before I bought these. They feel  very good to the touch and you can tell they are made from high quality  material. The image is clear just like the picture shown. I was not expecting much but I’m very pleasantly surprised and impressed.  Now I have to buy more of these for the other bedrooms!!! This image is with full morning sun behind them. In more indirect light, there is a softer glow. My daughter loves them, the color is just a little off but overall we are happy and I would buy again. Love, love, love these curtains! They are absolutely perfect for our bedroom. The colors are marvelous and the price was very good. When I wake up in the morning and look at them, I feel I just have to walk a couple steps to get in the water. What a view I have!!! I was looking for something unique that could double as artwork in my open livingroom with a big picture window. This company and these curtains totally fit the bill. I am unsure if they will launder well. I\\'ve gotten lots of compliments from friends and family asking where I got them. This was a great purchase for an eye-catching product at the fraction of the price of some plain-jane curtains. This looks beautiful and really brightens up the living room with color, especially with the sun behind it. Still blocks light efficiently. Love these curtains! This curtain hangs well and looks great. The greys are soft and the effect is very nice. They look great, I just wish it were easier to get the wrinkles out. Color and sharpness is way off from picture not what I was expecting at all Awesome quality these are so beautiful , they are worth every penny ,great for any Egyptian room :) I\\'m so happy with my curtains!! The material is not thick, but not thin. The picture is clear and so looks real. Light filters through (first picture from morning light) which nicely highlights the street scene. 90\" was long for my glass doors,  but I do not care. The rod is moved higher so I have more of the picture scene to display! No need to iron. Arrived quicker than arrival date. No smell. Love these!! Great quality, beautiful realistic looking as shown sunset over the ocean , full light coverage, thick , but silky fabric , thank you ! Very nice curtains but the detail is not as good as I was expecting but for my young daughter they will be perfect These curtains are wonderful.  They are not as darkly printed as in the picture.  But they have a good weight and filter light beautifully. only received one panel. \"sad face\"  But otherwise I like it. starting to come apart and only had it a few months Love these curtains!! They\\'re very good quality. You can\\'t see through them, yet they let the sunshine in. When we don\\'t get to the beach it seems like we\\'re already at the beach. Not very opaque, washed out the colors of the print with the setting sun. A little high on the cost but good quality love it Really nice for my office devider I chose these curtains b/c it is hard to find nice patterns but unfortunately they are not of great quality. The colors are definitely not as vibrant as they may seem on the picture but the print is still attractive. I ordered the 84 inch length and it is 79 inch so I have to move the curtain rods down, which is a pain b/c of patching and painting the holes afterwards. The material feels more like plastic than satin, not very nice. When the curtains are drawn in the wrinkles this causes remain throughout the curtain and are quite visible when drawn out in the evening. So it always looks like its in dire need of ironing, which you cannot really do with plastic... The stitching is not great either. The trim in the middle where the patterns meet is not the same width on the right and left sides which is again quite visible b/c the thread and back-folded fabric shows through the light colors of the pattern. It is probably less visible with a darker background. I have come very close to returning this curtain for the above reasons but I would not know what to exchange it to b/c the others that have similarly nice and unusual patterns ship from China that takes over a month and not sure how easy it would be to return those if they have similar issues. All in all it is not worth $65. This curtain panel set is beautiful.  The picture is very clear.  I swear I can see people in the windows with a magnifying glass.  I washed them on cold gentle cycle and dried them for 20 minutes on low and they look amazing.  I did sew a 1/2 inch seam across the top so the curtain would sit up just a little off the rod and not be flush on top of the rod.  They arrived quickly and well protected. Wrong size. Colors are absolutely nothing like the picture. It look like a cheap copy of the real curtain. I want my money back. Returning them asap. I need 63 inches long like I purchased. color doesn\\'t look like in the picture Looked similar to the picture, and even though the material seems kind of thin they block out the light pretty good. I thought it was a real bar door sorry Love these curtains they are beautiful at night. They look like the light is glowing. Cute The pic looks more realistic than in person but they are still cool Great quality and looks just like picture Adds a nice splash of color darkens well too my wife loves this curtain light still shines somewhat but that doesnt matter to her she loves looking out at the water Hellooo I receive my order missing the sport decor I only receive the gray curtains what I should do I need this item very bad to finish my kids bedroom project thanks Perfect size. It looks amazing! The quality is so perfect! Beautiful!!! Great purchase, better than the add Perfect for my boys superhero room. Used in place of closet doors. Great quality and image. These curtains are just wonderful! We purchased these as we needed something unique and not tacky for the billiards room. They\\'re exactly as described in the photo. The curtains also have a nice thickness to them and don\\'t look \"cheap\" at all. Great product. Perfect for my son\\'s room decor-the great outdoors. These let in a moderate amount of light, definitely heavy enough to block extreme sunlight. Very well made and exactly like we expected from the product description. I use this curtain as a cover for my kids closet.  The closet door was not very stable and this is much easier to get in and out of. Absolutely perfect - the curtains were true to discription. nan Very pretty especially wen the sun hits it.. Super cute for my daughters music studio. They kind of look like shower curtains. The quality is as pictured. Very nice!! Right colors They look funny The curtains were way to short. Barely covered the window. Very nice quality My was alittle more orange then red brick. But still like it. I have a very large window so I bought two sets of these and they look awesome in my game room! Returned. The pattern is much more muted than depicted and the ‘beach’ is too close to the floor. Very nice curtains. Great satiny material. These were to long but I cut them off and stitched a new rod pocket with a top ruffle and they turned out great. Stunning..well made curtains...Gorgeous view of Central Park...brings some NYC back into my life upstate! Just  be aware these are heavy and room darkening....I am using them with hold back hooks to let daylight in...I am in love with these unique curtains... I knew I was going to like this product when I ordered but I love it’s more each day. The curtains look beautiful when the sun is shining through them, it adds more life the picture! Totally awesome curtains. If it’s dark and you turn a light on behind them, the curtains become alive, showing a sunset in the moving water. I will definetly being buying others. The price is right, wide variety of different scenes. I hung this behind my bed in my small but very cozy room, it looks beautiful. Quite good quality too They was alright not exactly like picture Nice but colors not as rich as soon in the picture She loves them. Amazing colors!! Perfect for my kitchen!! Love love love. Beautiful!  Definitely not good at blocking the light.  I sewed a cheap purple sheet to the back which helped. my wife loved it!!! Not impress This curtain is best in large areas. Not for smaller rooms. Material is awful. Not a bedroom curtain<br>Would be fine for bathroom<br>VERRY disappointed  Used 2 sets as wedding backdrop. So many comments on how beautiful it was. Many thought I had it custom made. They were all shocked to hear it was a curtain ordered online. The dragon curtains look like the photo (maybe a little more pale, but not significantly so in my opinion) and my husband loves them. I like that it isn\\'t a creepy/scary dragon or a cutesy cartoon dragon. This curtain doesn\\'t block out the light completely but the back-lighting only adds to the scene.  It hangs well and needs steaming to work out the wrinkles from shipping.  My husband and I love this purchase. Great picture. Cheap fabric. Could be done better for the price. The curtain is beautiful and is made of a strong material. Live these curtains.  They were just what I needed to create the right ambience in our RV and allowed the creation of separate spaces. Awesome drapes, my 7 year old grandson loves them!! Exactly what we ordered. Love them I just received my new curtains... bought the blue Tibetan, misty, mountain, bare tree\\'s. The tree branches are more of a blue in hue, rather than black, which is just fine. I love the dramatic look, they will add to my living room! Oh, so.... very PLEASED!!! It was thin, very see through and colors not as vibrant as it is on site Initial order received was the wrong size. The seller replaced in a timely fashion and I returned the incorrect product. The reason for 4 stars is the initial mix up. Otherwise the product is exactly as pictured, great quality and my daughter loves it in her room! Beautiful!  Was afraid they would look like shower curtains, but they were very well made and quite lovely. Very cool. I live in Alaska and these are not true blackout curtains though. Not see through is more accurate. great find and I\\'m pleased. These curtains are decadent...beautiful like an oil painting..and very reminiscent of Venice...Just be aware they are heavy..like room darkeners...so I am putting up tie backs so I can let the light in...I am thrilled with them! These curtains are exactly what I was looking for. Good quality and the sky looks amazing when sun filters through them! I got the continents and animals curtains. they were absolutely stunning they make the Room look great and I absolutely love the colors and material, really brought my daughter\\'s Room to life! They are as advertised and love them I was surprised at the quality of the curtains.  It appears to be very durable and almost opaque. It was what I expected.  Would order again. Absolutely beautiful!  Looks like a painting!  Proud to have! great quality, look beautiful They do not look as shown, the colors are faded. So beautiful!!! I like be them!! I put these up in my classroom, and my students and I really like them. When Are you going to make 120\" wide landscape curtains? Very cool and looks exactly like the picture. Colors are accurate. Well made and lined which makes them darken the room a little. Definitely worth the money. fast delivery. perfect condition. good looking. product well described our daughter loves it! Curtains exactly as described. I love how they look! I used it as a pipe and drape to cover a hideous wall where I’m currently renting. Really really beautiful, don\\'t hesitate, you won\\'t be sorry.  Even more lovely in person. Was what it said it was and was shipped fast Loved the product.  Fast shipping. perfect fit for my window and the theme i\\'ve got for the room Love, love, love these curtains! This is the second pair of ambesonne curtains I\\'ve purchased and they are really well made.  I shortened these to fit perfectly on the back door of our toyhauler so we don\\'t have to look at a big black wall when the door is closed and they go really well with all of my pictures that I took while in the Grand Tetons. Overall, not a bad product, but the definition of the mural should be of a higher quality - however, I am happy with it, overall - the quality of the material seems to be good, we\\'ll see how it holds up. Bought as gift for daughter and she hung them immediately! just what I needed for my project good service I absolutely love this curtain; and so does everyone who visits my classroom!  I use it to cover a storage space; but it will be a great addition wherever you hang it. Great backdrop for the money. I love the idea and will probably order more for other windows but the image on the actual item is a lot less vibrant then the image showed a little disappointed and wish would have shown in the picture or at least mentioned in the description These curtains are so beautiful.  The quality of the fabric is outstanding.  Thank you for your beautiful product.  I only wish there were more to match the Disney wall murals.  I would definitely buy again!  Great quality. Excellent quality and colors beautiful<br> My grand daughter loves the curtain in her room<br>I definitely will purchase more from this company I purchased these curtains and ended up returning them. They look cheap, are thin and poor quality. Fortunately it is easy to return things on Amazon. The price My daughter love it This Curtain is subtle and peaceful.  It has good body and a silky hand.  The water will sneak up on you and you can almost hear it in the back ground. I find that I leave it closed even in the daytime as the colors are soft and it lets some light in.  It is nice to combine with other Ambesonne Nature scenes as it softly blends. Just Beautiful. very nice quality. In today\\'s world, that\\'s rare.  However, the design is a little greener and larger than I\\'d anticipated based on the picture here. Still, an excellent product and a beautiful addition to the parlor. I love it wife hates it I purchased this curtain for my large family room patio door and absolutely love it! The workmanship is excellent, the fabric quality outstanding and the visual effect stunning. I will order more products from this company. I bought it for my mom, it\\'s absolutely beautiful.The picture was bright and it makes you feel like you\\'re on beach. Love the look and material Liked a lot. I ordered these to use as a backdrop for a prom with a Moroccan theme.  They were vibrant and colorful and worked well for the purpose.  I also liked that they came with shower curtain rings which I used to hang them.  It saved me a trip to a store to purchase something to hang these curtains. Those are 50% transparency. They look so great up. Flowers a lot larger than shown picture on website. Disappointed.  Not really what I wanted, however that is the risk you take.<br>We will try to sell them. Looks just like the photo Very nice!! Only one issue I wish top had a little room after putting the curtain on the rod length and width is shorter than expected. Thin material cause too much light to come thru These are very nice and good quality would recommend for any sun room here in southern coastal Florida I like  it over all These curtains are a huge bang for your buck! I ordered the 90” length to hang floor to ceiling in my five year old daughter’s bedroom rather than dropping a ton of money on mural style floral wallpaper. The print is sharp and the colors are lovely. They are well sewn and straight - everything I hoped for but nicer than expected. I was able to steam all of the wrinkles out easily. The colors are vibrant AND muted so you can mix them with other patterns/colors easily.<br><br>I would recommend them to anyone. Extremely impressed atthe quality and price point! I bought the floral pattern, and it is gorgeous! I was concerned about the printing, but it looked great. The colors were vibrant, and the pattern is just as beautiful as in the picture. They felt like simple construction, but sturdy. I think these curtains would hold up well over time. Unfortunately, they ended up not going with my decor. I was so bummed!!!! They seriously are gorgeous! They also came packaged well. I have large picture windows in my kitchen so when the curtains are closed, the tree branches with birds mimic the outside view of the yard.  The scene is very pretty to look at- The curtains themselves are kind of a satin feel/finish.  They aren\\'t shiny but they do have a sort of oriental style/feel to them, reminds me of a beautiful kimono.  I do like them, it seems like they will last me a long time. these curtain are exactly what we wanted. They are beautiful. We put them up over our slider in our family room. They came package well and on the day specified. I will purchase more curtains from them. I cannot tell how in love with these curtains I am! I get happy just looking at them! I gets lots and lots of compliments on them, too. Great quality. Very beautiful. Returned  Too shiny Love these. These curtains work well with our nursery but am disappointed that there is no other sizes available as it is very large for the window we have.  Also, there was a \"smear\" in the pattern while printing that caused a weird ghosting in the curtains. Super cool curtains, I absolutely love the print but I wish they were thicker. If you are looking for a black out curtain or something to really keep light out this is not what you want. However if you just want something pretty to look at rather than the busy street they are the perfect way to feel like you\\'re out of the city without leaving home  &lt;3 Absolutely love these curtains. The only reason they\\'re getting a 4 is because they\\'re a little thinner than I hoped, but it worked out.  When the sun hits them, they look amazing. Submitted a pic with the sun on them. They’re lovely, but sewing is horrendous. Bottom and side hems are crooked so they hang oddly. Not noticeable at a glance, but very noticeable when hanging. I\\'m really pleased with the quality of the print, fabric, and sewing.  Image is distinct and appears as expected / shown. The two curtains line up perfectly and I use them to cover a boring, ugly wall rather than a window.  It\\'s like a huge piece of art hanging on my wall and makes the room pop. They look beautiful up. Looks awesome on my sliding doors, thicker then I thought would be, made very good Disappointed in the color an quality!  It looks so vibrant and well made on line but in reality it looks like a huge shower curtain. These curtains are amazing and everyone who sees them spends a lot of time looking over them learning new places. I LOVE these curtains! Vibrant colors really perk up the room, and bring the outdoors inside! Looks awesome in my office and creates a relaxing atmosphere. Print is good quality and not pixalated. Like the art, used it for my office. Product was delivered as described. Great for the money perfect picture.. Super fast delivery!  Curtains are lined and beautifully done!!!  I am VERY PLEASED! Did not appear as it did on line. Nice like the quality Awesome Fits window perfectly Beautiful!!! I am ordering some more.. I put them up in my dining room. Now everybody wants to order some I love these curtains I have them in my den, going to order another set. Absolutely  love this curtain set. Looks so beautiful  in my living room . fast delivery. perfect condition. good looking. product well described our daughter loves it! more that expected These are beautiful well made curtains. The design and color is exactly what is shown. Really looks like the picture and brightens the room. Bought this to cover the closet space for my boys\\' bedroom instead of using heavy closet sliding doors.  My boys love this curtain and it makes their room look very cool.  Dragons are always cool. Beautiful My daughter and I couldn\\'t agree on curtains for her room until we saw these.  They look lovely when up and allow some light to filter through when closed.  My only warning is wash then twice because they smell of a weird amount/kind of dust.  It did wash out, but it was unbearable until washed! very cute, not sure if we keeping it tho...<br>its a bit too glosy, drawing is beautiful but the fabric looks a bit cheap ... Resolution of the picture is not as good as I was expecting when you look closely. Curtains on the webpage are not a photo of the real product, I think the digital picture (with very nice resolution) is overlaped over the curtains. It does make the effect of a nice beach though, when you look from far behind. Sewing is just ok. Blurry, really can\\'t tell what it is The pattern is cheap &amp; the colors are more greenish than grey. My delivery came Sunday, The curtains are beautiful however they came unsize what i mean by that one curtain is longer then the other,so I have uneven curtains in my living room I love it, it\\'s beautiful! nan Beautiful curtains. Thank you. Arrived faster than promised. I love these curtains! They are soft, smooth, and slightly heavy. They are not blackout curtains, but they do keep out enough of the light to make it easy to sleep during the day. The picture is clear, just as if I\\'d ordered a picture blanket.  I have attached two pictures...the darker one was taken early in the morning, and the brighter one was taken during the afternoon. I would highly recommend any of these curtains with scenes on them. Just got delivered today, two days ahead of expected delivery. Very nice fabric, heavy back, nicely made. I love this curtain as I my favorite color combo is red, white and black. The only one thing I don\\'t like is that it is too faded on the top left and middle. I wish it was the same bright color as it is on the right. It does look nice though. My daughter hung these over her sliding glass door, they look great! this was really beautiful but it just didnt work for my grdgrls bunkbed fort.. fabric was too thick. I love these curtains. They make me smile out loud every time I walk into my kitchen. This item more than met my expectations!!!! Very pretty, but also very thin. You almost feel like your feet are getting wet.  It is a really neat look. I love the colors it match  my living room suite perfectly Perfect in every way! Absolutely beautiful! These curtains are pretty cool but not as dark or clear as in the picture. These are beautiful and high quality the manufacturer made sure to cut them so if the curtains over lap a little bit the writing would still be legible Love this item. Quality is great, price is good. Looks awesome hanging in my living room. Really brings out my \"travel theme\" and a great conversation piece when friends and family visits. Highly recommended. They are beautiful! Good quality and have made my living room soooo spooky! Very beautiful and well made. So much fun for Halloween.  Used at my sliding glass door and totally love the look. I deflict the roaring 50<br>A very family erra<br>Mad my mom so happy l almost cryed<br>Mom and Dad are 90s they love it Nice quality and colors. They were not weatherized they made my little tiny living room get really hot in the house the tree did not match up on the curtain to make it look 3-D so it came out to be something I could have printed on a thin curtain myself Wow! These curtains are beach Front property.<br>\"Exquisitely Beautiful\"<br>Thanks, Beautiful design, strong fabric, light still comes through, but they make the room look contemporary and stylish! My curtain looks nothing like the photo. The print is faded and looks like a bathroom curtain We hung this behind our parrot\\'s play stand to protect the walls.  Looks really nice, easy to clean and she seem to like it to.  The colors are vibrant.  The material was of good weight and felt silky to the touch.  The fact that they are machine washable really sealed the deal. Loved them. Great material and true coloring. I think they are ugly but he doesn’t care I love the curtains!!! They look great in my bedroom and go along with the barn look paneling we have. These are  polyester, but that helps them to be light-weight. The pattern is terrific, and they help make a small bedroom bigger. I think the price is a tad steep, but the heart wants what the heart wants. Love these curtains!! Hung 2 sets of 108\" x 96\" around 2 sides of our hot tub as a privacy barrier.  They match the decor in my log home perfectly. This curtain is absolutely amazing! Exactly what we were looking for!! It looks great both during the day and at night! Absolutely perfect. I used it for a rustic theme dessert table back drop! So many compliments for these curtains. Will purchase again from this company! There is nothing wrong with the product, they just don\\'t look good in my house.  I would like to return them but it says my window to return is closed.  Is there any way I can return these? Nice but I  kept  thinking they looked like shower curtains. So I put them on a rod and now I have a great shower curtain. They are beautiful I didn’t expect them to have the shine. These are perfect for my egyptian themed kitchen. Gorgeous! Purchased these to use as a room divider in my loft area. The quality is nice and thick. The \"wood\" design is attractive and unique and I have had many compliments on the design. Quilty seemed ok, print was a little blurry, synthetic curtians.<br>Got the wrong item twice though... Great product , color has expected Prettier in person Goes nice with my sunflower kitchen decor Beautiful Color not exactly as shown It\\'s beautiful, dont get me wrong but it wasnt the one I ordered :( because I ordered the teal curtains with the cherry blossom design,I\\'ll keep them it\\'s just alittle dissatisfying ,maybe there was a mix up? Adorable &amp; exactly what I needed to make my space bright but not see through. (Excuse the mess, we like to lounge with our blankets) No joke. These curtains are stunning. I was so worried that it would look like a cheap Hawaiian shirt, but no. The print is rich, large, and has many tones of green with both yellow and blue undertones.  Ties everything in the room together. I\\'ll add grommets soon for easier sliding. The curtains were exactly as shown; made out of thick, durable material. People cannot see through them but they\\'re not blackout. they look so good!!!! the panels are wide!!! I wanted them for a closet space in the hall &amp; this curtain looks awesome!!!! I love the curtains!  They are satin, but have a nice weight to them.  They look fantastic hanging up! These curtains turned-out more than perfect!  I\\'m so happy with this purchase! :D Impressed with curtains. Added a unique appearance to den Absolutely beautiful!!! Love it fabric very silky soft and sturdy!!!! Love these curtains.  Absolutely beautiful.  Thanks so much for such a beautiful product Ugly.. nothing like it is depicted. But I should have paid more attention Just didn\\'t look right in my home, returned with no problem at all. Thank you! they\\'re wicked blurry in real life Perfect backdrop for my dinning room. I definitely will order more for different seasons. Love these curtains! The panels line up perfectly as if a continuous curtain. Excellent 3D effect.  Definitely a must have! This is what I received today. Clearly not what is pictured. Love these! Awesome for the entrance to the theater room! They are a little wrinkle and just need a few passes with the iron. I’ll get around to it one day, but they still look great. Upon seeing these advertised curtains, I knew they were exactly what I was looking for. When they arrived I hung them immediately. Not only have they decreased the amount of light from my East facing windows, but have added a gorgeous dimension of color and debth to the room. Love these curtains you sometimes have to think outside the box I needed to mount rod lower than normal so that I could show my nice moldings it made the curtain set lower so I just needed to take them to a tailor and have them shortened there now perfect I like the size of the curtains and it covered all of my window. The Design was great also. What I liked least was the weight. It was to heavy for my curtain rod. I found the material to be of better quality than I expected, not flimsy.  Delivery was very prompt. Perfect for the holidays. Received many compliments. they look like the picture.  Nice material. These are beautiful curtains and design, but the fabric is see-through a bit. So the light comes in. Bothers me a bit. I use them as backdrops in our church. cheap, cheap, cheap. In terms of quality and looks. both. Absolutely beautiful curtains, my living room really was in the christmas spirit when I put these one.  Got a lot of compliments from my friends and guest during the holidays. These are so cute!!!  So glad i purchased them for the holiday! Using at Huntjng at hinting camp works great These curtains look nothing like the picture. Do not buy these curtains if you are expecting red and black primitive look. They are actually an orange color in person Bought it for my home office. Perfect  work space Great product, goes great with room theme Awesome curtains, my daughter in love with it. The picture was nothing like the product actually sent the curtains back Nice curtain. This hangs very nice and looks great. EXCELLENT Es bellísima I haven\\'t put these up yet, because I want to iron them first, but I love the way they look. It looks like a real scene and you feel like you can go through that door into another world!  I already have the ocean scene ones up, and I love them too, but I wanted to change to a more fall like scene for the next few months. I think any of these curtains are good! Great quality I have the Sliding glass door open so the wind looks like it is moving the air ship Looked nicer in pics  Love them use them for work No complaints at all. Awesome  they look amazing from inside the room and outside looking at the window. One of my Best Buy’s ever nan Great product. Beautiful ... will purchase more items from this seller. They are just Beautiful, I am an outdoor lover and this just brings some inside to me, I love them they are very good quality, hang great, all the pieces fir from one curtain to the next. Just my opinion but love love love them. I was extremely disappointed with this item.  I sent it back.  The color is not very similar to what is posted.  Additionally, the \"focus\" on the art is not very crisp.  I was really looking forward to having this in my home, but it just didn\\'t work. Living in Florida brings me back home. They truly show the daylight, but also are well insulated for blackout curtains.<br>I have them in my dining room that leads out to my patio with French Doors and a 3rd window. Perfect fit. They are nice for our upcoming Autumn decoration. Happy with with it.  Love these curtains for my living room!  A couple of things though.<br>First the hems were quite uneven and I ended up unpicking them and re-sewing them.  Now they look great!  Second, they could use a wider size.  I know many homes have bigger windows and I made these work but just barely!  2 or 3 inches smaller and they would have had to go back.  Closed they pretty much stretch all the way across.  Last, when I shirred them on it was hard to open and close.  Solution; I bought clip on rings.  Now they move back and forth nicely and I love the way they look! a small portion of the curtain\\'s sublimated design was missing and left a big white spot in the tree.  We had to draw the rest of it in with markers and it\\'s obvious where it was messed up.  My mom refuses to send it back though because it was so much trouble installing lol. These curtains surpassed my expectations. I have them hanging in my newly painted living room and they are beautiful. The fabric is like a heavy satin, although without the glossy appearance of satin.<br>I smile each time I look at them. This curtain was pretty, however when pushing to the side of my sliding glass door it bunched up a lot in the corner.  It was extra long and too wide.  This would be nice on a regular window that you want to keep covered. ♡♡♡ these curtains. Turns out not wide enough for my applicatiin. Pattern prohibits ordering more to add. Regrettably returned to Amazon. Really like these curtains best ones I\\'ve ever bought Thank you Love the colors very good I just bought these curtains for my living room.  They are beautiful and the fabric is very nice.  Blocks sun out nicely.  I would highly recommend them. To small Very nice great quality, quick shipment, pet hair doesn\\'t stick to it is a bonus Looks very nice :) Love them!! Description is on key!!! I have been more frustrated with the last TWO purchases of this product than with anything else! Tried to talk to the vendor, but never heard back! Unhappy about that. I ordered one of these curtains a couple of years ago &amp; loved it so much I wanted a back-up.  The two times I\\'ve ordered it again, it came all faded and pink tones instead of the warm golden tones of the first one!  DISAPPOINTING FAIL!  And a bad seller! In a word....GORGEOUS!!! These curtains are so gorgeous! They bring the outdoors in and on a dreary day it still looks like it is beautiful outside. They aren\\'t heavy but they aren\\'t see through either. They are just perfect for what I needed. I like them. They give my small computer room a deceptive out door look. They also allow some sunlight in which is why I wish they were a little thicker because the room may be a little colder when the temperature really goes starts to go down. I love these curtains, they are not as pretty during the day as they are at night, but they allow some light in during the day which is nice.  I am very happy with my purchase and would buy them again.  They are good price for the quality, I would recommend them to a friend. I wanted something different for a window in the kid\\'s play area and this was perfect! We get a lot of compliments and I am very pleased with the purchase. Brings such a warm &amp; calm feel to the room Shipping was not overly fast.  It\\'s worth the wait though. Awesome Love it! Looks just like the picture. So excited to finally have them up! Allows just enough light in yet insures your privacy My new favorite curtains in the living room, the print is great quality and it’s definitely an eyecatcher. The curtains are thick enough to block out most light. The curtains are very nice, although the colors are a bit different.  You\\'ll want to put them in the dryer for. Bit to get the hard told lines out.  They are beautiful. Imagery was not as \\'real\\' and natural as the ad.  Texture felt too synthetic. Very cheesy looking. Thought they were actually bamboo. Perfect size and item as described This curtain is very well made and excellent quality. I love it and it was delivered head of schedule Look very carefully at what you are buying These curtains are awesome. I used the curtains for my display of Egypt in my classroom.  Everyone loved it and the quality is great! Material too thick!!! Like choir robs. I love this product looks good Beautiful and very good quality. Nice! Beautiful, breathtaking... They was not as Dark as i thought they was going to be. I kept them but had to buy darker ones as well.. Not enough stars to tell you how much we like these curtains. At first, a bit put off by the slight sheen I noticed outside in the sunlight. But in the house, the sheen didn\\'t even show up. Would totally recommend these! Best barn door curtains ever! A cheap alternative to real barn doors. Excellent seller as promised  And fast shipping! We\\'ll be back was nice quality and pretty but I needed it with grommets so I sent it back  It did not work for me but if I did not need the grommets I would have kept it I like the weight of these curtains; they block some of the street light in my bedroom. They look nothing like the website photos. Will not buy from this manufacturer again. Products are cheap materials and very poor dyes. Not even close in color???? PINK i see no pink on website We love them Just as described quality made curtains. Very realistic ! Beautiful and great quality These curtains are fantastic. nice quality I bought this for my 4.5 year old son\\'s bedroom. My son liked it very much. However, he found few inconsistency in the map from his globe. Here are few mistakes in the map, Decca should be Dhaka, Rangoon should be Yangon, Peking should be Beijing. As advertised,  looks good adds character to the room The sun looks like a faded white spot. The whole picture is not nearly as bright and saturated in color as the picture. And there is a tiny - looks like a face - randomly inserted. I\\'m keeping it out of laziness. I needed to (finally) take down the winter darkening curtains and let light in. On this measure, they\\'re okay. Lightens the room and holds privacy. Nice weight. Desired effect does not look like the picture. For the price, I would say no. These curtains are SO pretty! The image/print pops nicely but isn\\'t \"loud\" and it helps create a perfect ambiance for falling asleep (especially if you are a space nerd like me. I can stare at Hubble images and just get lost in thought). They are definitely not blackout curtains, but thick enough for privacy. They washed well, no bleeding or anything. I plan to steam the wrinkles out this weekend. The fabric is more satin-y than that silky poly that heavier curtains have. I would definitely buy these again! I LOVE the curtains SO much!!!<br>They\\'re so beautiful in pictures &amp; even more in real life! These curtains will make you &amp; your home feel so relaxed. The quality of these curtains is very good, they\\'re nice and thick, you cant see through them during the day &amp; they keep the sun out very well. At night time the colors in the curtain change. Its so amazing, during the day when the sun is up, it will have your curtain looking like a sunny beach day, glowing oranges &amp; yellows off the water &amp; the sky is so bright &amp; at night ad the sun sets outside it looks like its really setting on your curtains. The brightness of the sky turns to an overcast day, into a midnight setting. The waters oranges &amp; yellows now turn to a goldish color as the sun sets on the water &amp; reflects. They are so perfect. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE them. Thank you!!! I  moved from Florida to North Carolina and wanted a beach theme for my living room...found these along with wall hanging...purchased five wall hangings, one for wall, one for loveseat, two for sofa, and one for floor (which I reinforced and made into rug for under coffee table).  Loving it. These curtains are absolutely  stunning! My windows are not that  wide so I placed only 1 curtain panel per window, but this didn\\'t  detract from the beautiful  appearance! I wouldn\\'t  hesitate to buy another set for my beach home! The thickness of them they\\'re really nice for the price and they look like real curtains  versus if you go to Walmart something Before they arrived, I was a little concerned that the quality of these curtains would not be good, but the material is thick and the photo translates well to the fabric. It’s nice to wake up to this scene rather than the boring old dark brown curtains I used to have on my window. Overall, these greatly exceeeded my expectations! Absolutely gorgeous, thick and silky.  Already got compliments on these.  I used them as single panels on small sliding glass doors and used other curtains as the side panels--got two for the price of one! I have a really big window so I got two of those curtains(4palnels). They look nice but one of the panels kind of shorter than the others. Also they look different at day time. But overall the just fine. Made my little reading room into a summer fun room . what says summer more than a beach and  High on price but fantastic on the quality.  So worth it for my daughters room. LOOKS NICE AND KEEPS THE SUN OUT OF MY LIVING ROOM, WHILE WATCHING TV.. Very Pleased With Purchase! Looks Great! love it It good but not have circles ring on and it doesn’t blackout Very very beautiful! love the material. Beautiful, I don\\'t want to open the curtains for my indoor plants  It\\'s a beautiful picture and looks great in the space.  The length is not the same one side is shorter. That\\'s the reason for the 3 stars. I love these curtains. Bright beautiful colors. Good material. beautiful colors.looks so real. It was different from the picture I bought these curtains a year &amp; a half ago. I decided to see how well they held up before I recommended to any Amazon buyer. These curtains are far better than any curtain I have EVER purchased. They wash beautifully &amp; don\\'t require ironing, but would recommend taking them out of the dryer a little dampish. Picture looks beautiful with sunlight coming through it but not sheer enough to cause glare. I was so impressed with them I just purchased a second pair in a different size &amp; picture. Size is true to what it states, color in picture hasn\\'t faded after multiple washes (cold water recommended). They\\'re not as dark or as purple as the photos show, more blue, but they worked well for what I needed and they\\'re pretty decent quality, they feel thick and silky. I\\'m pleasantly surprised. Beautiful vibrant colors, and gorgeous detail! Light does shine through a bit, so they definitely look better at night, but overall exactly as described!! We bought these curtains for our granddaughters bedroom. She loves them! They are heavier than I expected and well made. The fabric is beautiful. A very good purchase. Absolutely beautiful, longer than you might think at least 6 1/2 feet long. Gorgeous, great quality &amp; sharp colors<br>Wish they made some smaller sizes too not just 83\" long. I love these.  They go great with my new bedspread.. These are nice heavy lined curtains. They were better than I expected and arrived on time. Needs a little thickness. Light shines through dimming the colors. No me gusto devolverlo Heavier than I thought they would be and look alot different from the pic.  Still look good bit not what I was expecting. These are awesome curtains  love this This was my first set. Love them poor quality pic and make cool I love these curtains but they\\'re not as dark as the picture makes them out to to be at night they look great I get five stars because it\\'s awesome but it\\'s not accurate to the picture Loved the look of it, it’s a tad small for my window but I don’t even care just the quality and style is awesome and when you stand outside in the day time you can totally tell it’s an American flag curtain which I love! Very happy with these curtains. Graphics fantastic, heavy/thick curtain higher quality than I expected. I would totally recommend this quality product. Exactly as advertised. Great length, not too much sunlight shows through, but enough to know the sun is still up. These are great! Also when outside you can see the American Flag as well which I really like but they also offer full privacy. I love Farmhouse/Americana Decor and these are perfect ❤️ Beautifully detailed.  Made with love. Nice quality They’re amazing!!! My son loves them!! The two reviews that complain about detail and material are way, WAY off. This giant curtain has a lot of detail in the print. So much so, it looks almost 3 dimensional. Seams are sturdy. It looks fantastic in real life. The first reviewer JJ must have been extra fussy that day. I think it’s a decent price for the quality of print. Zoom in on it for yourself. I’m very pleased with my purchase. These are awesome, totally helped transform our family room into a jungle for a Indiana Jones theme party.<br>Since I put them up in January and it\\'s winter here, the fam requested these curtains stay up to give a bit of green to these bleak months.<br>Stood up to kids and cats really well. Super pleased with these. Great curtain.  Looks just like the picture and has the blackout backing as well.  the curtain has the rod inserts as well.  it looks great hung up. The size of the cactus is impressive.  Its gorgeous.  Perfect size for my daughters windows and is like a centerpiece for the room. Very nice quality and they look great, it was just too big for what I needed.  But if the size works for you, they are very nice! These curtains are such nice quality and so pretty in my daughter\\'s bedroom! Color not true to photo at all. Was expecting vibrant, but colors were pastel-ish  and dull,  amd reminiscent of the early 90\\'s. Sent back. The quality was good, but the colors just weren\\'t as bright as pictured. Maybe that\\'s not the case for other designs. MOST MISLEADING ADVERTISING-DO NOT BUY!!!!!<br>The size is misleading, as my order states that the panels I paid for are supposed to be 108 W x 84 L, when in fact they are 62 L X 54 W per panel. THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH MANY BUYERS AND YET IT HASN\\'T BEEN ADDRESSED.<br>Even worse, there was a serious manipulation in the pixelation and color representation shown in the picture you order, as opposed to the actual product. the coloration is lighter colors and lower quality and the tiles themselves are larger, making it look cheaper still. I usually give generous reviews because I believe intent and integrity are everything in business. But clearly this business owner is a scoundrel of the worst kind. YOU SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. CONTACT ME ASAP.<br>P.S. I AM A JOURNALIST WITH SOCIAL MEDIA POWERS, AND I KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. I\\'D GIVE ME A REFUND IF I WERE YOU. CHEERS! My son was so pleased with these. They filter light well and cast a blue glow in the room. Not to shabby. Horrible for the price! Stitching is uneven as heck! One side has 1.5 stitch lip other side has .5 stitch lip. Great quality, easy to install. Perfect for hiding the clutter in the basement. These curtains are awesome! Got them for my sons room and he loves them. The sun behind them just makes them illuminate even more.  They are not thick which is exactly what I wanted. Just as I expected. Sending these back and not happy I have to pay for return shipping.  These don\\'t look anything like the picture - the material is terrible and cheap.  Could have bought these out of a bargain bin for $5.  Don\\'t waste your money!!  Worst purchase I\\'ve made on Amazon.  Ever. Hermosas cortina I was happy with the curtains but I thought I\\'d received only one panel.  The second panel had been removed from the package by someone else who wanted to see what it looked like.  ARGHHH.  In any case, I am thrilled with my curtains.  Great color, great material for my purposed and very vibrant and perfect for my space. The packaging was good and the delivery was terrific. I am a happy woman with these curtains. The colors are just like the photo and really brightens my  room up. OMG these curtains are a joke, look nothing like the picture AT ALL. Returned it The fabric is really cheap looking.  It\\'s extremely thin and has a weird plasticky sheen to it. The fabric is not as flexible as most curtains so unless your rod is longer than the length of the panel, it will look bunchy and weird on the curtain rod.  I\\'m keeping them for the design, which is great and looks like the picture, but otherwise I would have returned them.  I do NOT recommend buying these, they are extremely overpriced for the quality you\\'ll get.  There\\'s certainly better quality curtains on amazon for a better price. I returned it. Cheap quality They sent me two left-side prints :(. Decent quality tho, make sure you are prepared to iron out the wrinkles - used the cardboard box behind the hung curtain to do that. i read a lot about these prints before i bought one.  i did NOT use it over a window, but replaced folding closet doors with the 2 panels and curtain rod (see pic) - so it doesn\\'t have light streaming through it.  It would appear to be a good print job on decent material/fabric, but i do get what folks mean when they say the overall image seems faded.  It\\'s hard to get a good dark color on a porous/fabric surface.  I\\'m pleased with the purchase, i would have given it a 5 if the image was darker. I am a rocket scientist. When I saw these curtains after purchasing my first home and looking at curtains, I knew I had to have them for my bedroom. I bought one set and loved them even more in person; the print is well done and visually stunning when hung. I get tons of compliments on them and ended up buying a second set to curtain off my bedroom bathroom that doesn\\'t have a door yet. They\\'re good at blocking the light and just really fun and exciting to look at, plus feel very sturdy. I\\'m going to be painting my bedroom a purple to match some of the purple in the curtains and can\\'t wait to see the final result! Looks great, just not as great as it could. The print is not as dark as it looks online. Glad we got a Smokey forest pic because with light it would have been Smokey lightened looking anyway. We needed the 96 Inch size but this one does not come in that size so we\\'re settling with a short curtain. Otherwise it gas really changed the room for the better, I like having a feeling of the outdoors while in our bedroom. This set of curtains is very similar to other curtains that have printed scenes.  There is a fair amount of light that still bleeds through the curtain.  If you want more light blocking, then another layer of fabric is needed.  The graphic was really nice, and the colors are vibrant.  The construction is high quality and looks like it will last. These were a gift but I would definitely purchase a set for myself, they are very heavy duty and silky smooth.  They match a lot of decor settings, I can\\'t wait to see the final result when they are in place, and they will be high on my have to have list. We have a rustic cabin theme and this was just breathtaking.  I have three pairs of  Ambesonne window curtains and the quality is amazing.  I love to change them with the seasons.  Very pleased with our purchase. Looks great. Thought they were blackout curtions though. And they arnt. But in the black light they look really good. And it goes great with the theme for the room It\\'s much larger in person. The sizing is correct but man it is big. The print is nice quality even up close Love these! They are so beautiful and work great in the color schemes in my family room! Great purchase! These curtains are amazing. My grandson loves them in his room. And it looks so cool when the sun shines through it. It matches his duvet cover. These look great in my place and let in so much natural light. Nice ..not cheap looking. My daughter loves them..pretty long This is really neat. Not as dark as they looked online but otherwise served my purpose they are awesome, my granddaughters love them, nice thick curtains These are so cool and have such vibrant colors.  They look awesome in our living room and we always get compliments and asked where we got them from! Size a picture quality was good but colors were dull Patio door curtains.  Looked good .  Covered windows well. Great curtains for my sons room! My son loves sleeping in the woods! Disappointed and sent it right back. Picture must have been taken from a long distance with lights behind it. Beautiful scene, very clear and distinct.  Fabric is silky smooth and drapes nicely.  I decided to use them in my bedroom and it is like waking with a forest view each morning.  Worth every penny for the joy they bring me every day. EXCELLENT in every aspect of a Quality Product and the machine work is Perfect as well as the fine, sturdy material. Nothing but \"STARS\" for you and your company. I want more variety in scenery especially in trees, forest, shrubs, flowering trees and bushes. An absolute Quality product. Great curtains. Completed my movie themed room Very nice they feel and look very high class. Would recommend Daughter loves it!! Looks great. Wasn\\'t sure at first. Bought it to match a 5 Piece Painting I purchased. I ordered two for the living room windows. When it came it was not only of thick, quality, and DURABLE material, but it was GORGEOUS. Recieved many compliments in less than a week. Thank you. These are awesome curtains. My sons have a super hero theme bedroom and then I came across these! The quality is excellent. Everyone that sees the boys room always loves the curtains! The colors are washed out and curtain is thin. Does not look anything like picture. Like a shower curtain. Love it, best curtain ever, I incorrectly measured the area so a little long and bottom drags on floor but that is my fault not theirs. They go perfect in my guest room.  The quality is great and the design is fun! Absolutely love it!!! Amazing curtains for a nice feel to a room! The picture in the item description is absolutely gorgeous, and the curtains are ... not quite as gorgeous. They\\'re still lovely, but you\\'re not going to be getting deep purples and lush forest hues - more a nice lilac and a restful pastel green. Mellow shades rather than eye-popping color. My six-year-old daughter says they\\'re \"the second favorite thing in my room\", after a two-foot-tall Poppy plush from Trolls, and that\\'s high praise indeed. Would definitely still buy them - I see nothing better for the price. These curtains are as described, very lovely, good quality of print on the material. The material isn\\'t pure silk but a blend so it is sturdier but still has a silk look. Not light blocking but enough to reduce heat, perfect for my front room. Beautiful. Bright vibrant colors. As seen online. Excellent for a super heros room.  Makes it fabulous Very nice, hang perfectly. Really brightens up our living room and is nice to have during the winter months. My son loves these curtains. They look exactly like the picture and are made out of surprisingly nice fabric. We use them as photo op backdrops at our church! Great match to my concept Just unpacked this and hung it in my boys’ room - it looks so cool! It’s also quite thick and appears to be well made. I’m pleasantly surprised and the boys are thrilled. Fiesicimo  o se parece en nada a la foto y el precio no es el adecuado Best curtains ever!❤❤❤ This curtain is perfect my kids love it because they LOVE space and I love it because it fits the style of their room so well. Although it isn\\'t exactly like the picture I still like it. I was hoping the print would be a little darker on the curtain but it’s not. But I still like it. Still very beautiful. My son likes them. Some of the reviews suggested that they were darkening. They’re not. I’m going to buy some darkening curtains to put behind them. I’m satisfied with the purchase. I ordered this particular set of curtains due to my sentimental fondness for the image, but the print quality was not good enough to really bring out the scenery. One thing about ordering online is that not being able to see or touch the actual product can be misleading. I found the touch of the thin, polyester fabric unpleasant. I will say the curtains were well sewn with deep rod pockets. I was sorry they didn\\'t work out for me. This is just a stunning set of curtains. This is the 4th set I have bought and change it up with the seasons. Great for the very large window I have. We love this.  We hung it on a wall behind our hot tub.  Nice fabric, the graphics are clear and colors are vibrant. Pleasantly surprised. (1) Drapes are lined so cannot see thru. (2) Colors are great, looks like a beach view on my window. (3) Well constructed, straight hem, hang nicely. The curtains are okay but they are very heavy fabric and bulky. I wanted to use them for curtains on my closet but they didn\\'t open very far on the rod because of the bulk and because they aren\\'t on grommets. Also, they were very wrinkly and difficult to get straightened out to look more realistic. They would be much prettier on lightweight fabric. Had to send them back. Thick double paneled, nature scene on front and solid white on back. Nice quality material and good quality stitching. Colors are brilliant and looks real. My small bathroom with no natural lighting or a window feels less cloister phobic! Very frustrated with this purchase.  I received the product today and when I opened the box I found two left panels instead of a left and a right panel.  The right panel is supposed to have a knight on it.  See the attached picture which shows the two left panels I received.  I am unable to use the curtains due to this issue. The print that arrived looks NOTHING like the picture.  Different colors and shapes. It\\'s made of a kind of heavy polyester so it\\'s kinda silky. The picture is perfect. The colors are super bright. This is the second one I\\'ve had with a different picture.  Perfect and gorgeous every time. Seriously.  Worth the money. I used it to cover a huge whiteboard in my office so people couldn’t stare at my plans on the board when they stopped in to chat...much cheaper than buying a whiteboard with a door(s) of some kind. LOVE these! Están preciosas,me encantarón looks very nice, okay workmanship. Very good fabric. Thick and nice texture. I love these! I used one pair in the window and one pair as a closet door. Looks neato! These curtains take me to a magical, relaxing place everytime I go into the room! Loved this -- we are using it as a backdrop for a \"travel prom\" and it is great.  It is well constructed and easy to hang. Color not as vibrant as picture Perfect These curtains look just like the picture hanging up at my windows. Amazing same as I expected  These are so beautiful &amp; perfect for the baby\\'s room decor...matches perfectly My daughter loves these in her room. Blocks light when needed great quality fabric arrived fast Used these for a party really added to the backdrop. Thx I was dissapointed that I ordered the 90 in and got the 84in so I am returning.  I liked the colors and the curtains seemed decent quality for the price but I needed the 90in so I would rate the curtains 4 star and service 2 star. I found these to be more of a wall hanging than a curtain. It\\'s too much fun in the room they are in. I love how they curtains block out the light. Well worth the price.<br>I\\'d recommend them to anyone.<br>I live across from the water and this is a perfect fit for my bedroom.<br>I live in Florida &amp; since I put these up I don\\'t have to run my A/C early in the afternoon. Looks great, colors are bright but not as vivid as on the page. does not look like the picture shown and the material is cheap!!! Wasn\\'t as clear and pretty like the picture. Curtains were very wrikled. nan nan Fast delivery of a quality product! We are completely satisfied with our purchase!&nbsp; Not worth the money. Yuck! The colors are much brighter than pictured - almost fluorescent.  The material feels and looks like a shiny shower curtain.. Yuck, yuck, yuck  Returned them. I loved this picture of the curtains. the only problem is that during the daytime, it is blue. the sun shines through and the whole pattern is blue. it only looks like this at night. very sad. Vibrant colors. Very beautiful, and very good quality ! These are very nice but I didn\\'t decide I had no place for them until I had them too long to return.  However, while doing over my bathroom to make it more farmhouse style, I decided to use one of the panels as my shower curtain and it looks great.  I haven\\'t finished the bathroom yet, but will post pic when I do. Really, like this curtain. Was worried it would look cheesy, but, it doesn\\'t. Looks like an old door! Using it for a doorway curtain, between the kitchen and laundry room. I wish I could have purchased just one panel, as the doorway is too narrow for 2 panels, and, I have nowhere to use the other one:( Love these curtains. Use them as room dividers For the price, not so much love them not goo So gorgeous when you put them up. I put them in my kids room and they LOVE! Quality of material excellent - thick. Sharpness of image excellent. Stitching excellent. All excellent I absolutely LOVE these curtains!!!  They are well worth the price, and the material is silky yet heavier than I expected - just perfect for our Tuscan-themed home!!!!!  They seem to add another dimension to the room - almost like you could just walk right into the extremely detailed scene!!!! So cool!  Gives privacy over the sliding glass doors in our living room, but still lets a little light in. I liked the colors.  It is thinner than I had expected.  I am glad that I have blinds on that window. These curtians turned out better than expected.  Definitely a conversation piece. Beautiful It came out lighter in color than expected but I used it for a backdrop and the pictures turned out good so that is all that mattered Nice weight to fabric, satiny sheen. Good color and print quality. I purchased 120” Room Dividers tension rod (no screw holes!) from Amazon and used 1 ½” clip rings so easily slides back and forth on pole. His wall is exactly 10’ long x 8’ high clg height. His closet is 7’ wide so it covers it nicely. Had a knock a star off because seams not quite square at bottom of right panel and image doesn’t exactly line up from panel to panel. However for the price it’s a great value and my son loves it! I bought 2 sets of different wood scene curtains for my bedroom.  I picked two sets that looked as similar as possible.  And I LOVE them.  At first, I admit, I wasn’t sure.  They are a very different look and the fabric is sort of… shiny and thin…  So, for the first day or so I wasn’t sure.  But everyday I love them more.  I think it was just such a different look.  I am delighted with my purchase and love waking up in the woods. OMG they are BEAUTIFUL! I got Autumnal Foggy Park, and I LOVE them! Amazing. I had 2 pair of scenery curtains, but they had faded after 6 years. So I got these, and man, they POP! So glad I ordered them. I also love the fabric, much nicer than my old sets. I purchased the curtains with the Autumn Maple Trees because of the vivid red colors shown in the photo, but was disappointed with the actual curtains because the colors seem faded and much lighter than shown. Other than that, the curtains seem of good quality. If you buy the Ambersonne curtains, be prepared if they do not look as good as advertised. Look cheap Looked nice I returned since pic. Didn\\'t seem vibrant enough. Way too many trees took away from the pic. You may like it but I returned for a brighter beach pic. Looks great! I only wish it was double sided print so that people outside could see it too! The back is just white. The the image on the curtains is beautiful. It’s too short and nothing like the photo. Will be returning this item Color was nice but the material is kind of odd it\\'s kind of like hanging a shower curtain over a window These drapes brought enchantment to my room for Christmas..<br>Material is superior and so very well made.  The pattern is vivid and the picture does not do it justice. This is a great new colorful addition to my photobooth company :))) Love my sunset curtain Love this! A perfect piece for the man cave! I love it.. Christmas Purple Ball Curtains. Good fabric, nice weight fabric, easy wash and hangs nicely. Grandchild love these curtains. It brings out the geeky side and also the artistic side. It\\'s a great for the child that\\'s into science  And is a little bit geeky. Beautiful Love them. Bright and very colorful. Well made and a great product Very nice Look very nice. So far so good. Great product , looks amazing , covers the sun . Overall very happy with the purchase. Very bright and beautiful!  My daughter loves them! Looks exactly like picture I couldn\\'t believe it I\\'m going to buy a bunch more It\\'s perfect! Better than I imagined. Great quality These look amazing in my sons room!! He loves them!! Bath towel 5 stars Padio I love them!!! Awesome Conversation piece. Great product and received in a timely manner. We have been decorating our daughter\\'s room and we decided these would be perfect for the theme (to cover the large closet that has no doors).  They are exactly as described by the seller.  We do need to iron ours as they are slightly wrinkly, but they are quite lovely and my daughter is in love. The fabric for these is rather shower curtain-like - but great for the bathroom window I bought them for. They had a bit of chemical smell when out of the package, but after washing they are ok. I was iffy about ordering these because some curtains can look really cheap. Not these!  The look very elegant and are heavy material. Not a black out curtain, but it wasn\\'t advertised as blackout so I knew what I was getting. I ordered a second pair to fill in the window a little more. Fast shipping absolutely beautiful every time somebody comes to my house they compliment them there also a blackout curtain so you can\\'t see through them. So life like,,just the right weight and semi-room darkening from street lights,,,looks like a giant photo of the beach Love these curtains, used them for a back drop for stage, good quality fast shipping good quality print. Out of this world! I loved everything about these. I loved them so much I bought another for my daughter. Quality and scenic. I have not use yet.... the material is great Looks nice once hung on window. Nice change of scenery!! Nice divider for privacy, short of constructing an expensive door Beautiful LOVE it Love, love, love these curtains, they are used for our sliding door into our backyard and my husband just loves the theme, the way they feel, and, best of all, the map. Very pretty in the photo, but when received the “ice cream drizzle” didn’t line up.  The material was nice, just wish the panels lined up with each other. I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful these curtains were! Brightened up and made my living room so festive and nice!! Definitely recommend to buy these! I\\'ll be putting these up every year :) This year I did not put up a tree, I used the curtains to add festivity to my apartment. They did not fail, curtains look just lijue picture. I recieved many compliments. I got more compliments on these than any other decoration I put out! I hated taking them down but can\\'t wait to put them up again next Holiday! Great curtains. Keeps light out.....image doesnt seem as big as the picture. The photo in the online advertisement gives the appearance of a higher quality fabric and a more crisp, vivid photograph than the curtains actually have.  For this reason, I would say that they are overpriced.  Somewhat disappointed. Tal y del modo esperado These curtains are perfect. I have a sunroom which I use as part storage room and I wanted to hide that part. I decided to buy this because it has a gorgeous \"view\". Now when people look they see a view instead of storage! Very good quality. The colors are true to life. Love it. Great back drop<br>For Christmas. Lovely Great addition to my decorations this year. Love them. Just as advertised. Fun colorful. Entertaining for the cats and babies. Love these curtains and the matching duvet cover.  The curtains are more sheer than what it shows, as you can see in this picture.  The blinds behind the curtain are raised a little letting sunlight shine through. Love this curtain for my large livingroom window Pattern is uplifting Love the look. Got one for me my Mom and my sister! Love the quality of the material Very disappointed. The glass door is so small, you can barely appreciate the view to the beach. Very nice Same a the picture shown. Great quality.  Love the view. Nice curtains Love it Amazing material Beautiful colors Really look like Island Awesome Beautiful! Wow! These are far better in person then they are in the add...<br>  I love them and have gotten all great reviews from all that see them....<br> Also many Family and Friends have bought and all have great things to say about them... I got this to cover up the back carport gate, which is our outdoor Hoosier paradise. Getting football one for this fall. Love the colors. Looks hand painted.  Nice lightly lined. Great quality Very colorful and heavy duty Not like at photo quality so downgrade I really like the quality of the fabric and rich the presentation it makes. Color Great<br>For home I feel like I’m on vacation every time I enter the den. Curtains create a relaxing environment. Cute. Great deal for the price!! Very heavy. This product is all that it said it would be - Looking to make additional purchases! very good quality, but what does a guy know Love-Love-Love these curtains ! ! They give a great atmosphere to my Living Room. They are sheer enough to allow plenty  of sunlight, (&amp; yes - the curtains have a thin white lining). It\\'s also gives the room a nice ambiance. Very pleased ! ! Great purchase love the look amazing quality. The white background showing on the amazon website is not white but it’s yellow. Additionally there were black, brown and red ink spots that didn’t belong there. The curtain I’ve received looked old and the material felt like a shower curtain. Very disappointed. The white window frames you see in the picture are not white but they’re yellow. The curtain looks very cheap and the material feels like a shower curtain. Returned. Look great in my sons room Prefect for cabin decor Totally Love it These were way more gawdy and kitchy than I thought theyâ\\x80\\x99d be, the light coming through also gives your room a very red look. They were made well and look like the picture, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like them as much as I thought I would in-person so I returned them. I love it I ordered the forest scene for my livingroom and I love it! Now I can feel like I\\'m walking in the woods even on the cold, snowy days! The material is thinner than I would like, but good for the price. It is a little bit puckered up along the seams. great quality, love the design, looks amazing I actually bought these for a double-wide window that gets a lot of sun. Just gorgeous! They do have a good blackout effect. I can\\'t say enough good things about Ambesonne window/door treatments. Very bright colors. Beautiful curtains great print, not thick but they\\'re heavy. no real complaints but if i made curtains I would try for better hims and perhaps find a way to keep light from coming through. they look pretty cool though. im happy with them, they could be better though I\\'m creating a sanctuary space in one of my bedrooms.  I have purchased these curtains because they have the forest look I was looking for. I\\'ve painted the room a great shade of green, &amp; purchased from Amazon a wall mural that has a beautiful tree trunk in a forest. I can\\'t wait for it to be finished! I liked everything about it and if I had to I would buy it again. Quality very good and great value for the money.  however if you want something exactly like the picture shown you will be disappointed. The colors are very close but pattern different.  In this case it worked just fine for what I needed it for. I love it! Don\\'t know how it happened that I received two panels of very different lengths, but otherwise these look beautiful. The print is larger than I thought, and the books have titles, which you can\\'t see in the description. The curtains seem very well made and are lined with white. I wanted them to cover up my double closet that doesn\\'t have any doors. In a small room, the design might be overwhelming, but for a bigger space, they\\'d be great and would add some purrsonality! I really love the print. So we have cats. Weird cats. They destroyed the blinds (because they wanna see outside, big bay window next to the street we dont want the blinds open), so we got curtains, and the cats haven\\'t touched these babies because they can just jump underneath them to the window sil. They do a much better job at keeping the light out of the living room also which has been nice for movies and stuffs. I just love the moons. When I bought it I didn\\'t notice the little house the hill though, which made them slightly more kidish (thankfully we can hide that a bit), but the moons kinda over power that part also the house is not the first thing you notice, but I know where they\\'ll go in the future haha. love them. adds a pretty rustic charm without being campy. Not as pretty in person. Sliding glass door Ok The curtains were even nicer than I thought they would be. Fits perfect in my kitchen window. Love the picture didnâ\\x80\\x99t block the sun just fun to look at I bought this as a gift for someone, they said it works well and adds a lot of fun to their bathroom when they get out of the shower. Makes the room feel more like a jungle with the high humidity lol These curtains were perfect for what I needed and at a good price when I got them. They are a really good material. I needed to shorten them a little for what I wanted &amp; it was easy to trim with fabric scissors. So very thankful to have run across these. They add so much to my classroom. Curtains will not work. They are different than ordered. These are beautiful curtains. I cut them up and made several smaller curtains. These just look great! I walked in the room and was very pleasantly surprised at how the color and quality brightened the windows! I like it We used this curtain for my den. It added ambiance and incredible peace. It is so believable and mimics the outdoors. Could have a little more of the 3D effects but otherwise ok. I hung this up in the entryway to my laundry room. It’s perfect! Plus, when the eastern sun shines into the room in the morning, it looks like there is sun in this wooded scene. Deep colors and very clear lines. Great buy! Absolutely love these curtains. It is the second set I\\'ve purchased. It is just like being there. Will be ordering more!! These curtains are for my music room.  Perfect look ! Was poorly made Purchased these curtains as a backdrop to our tropical back yard party for picture taking.  Party isn\\'t until August, but I think it will be perfect! Love love these curtains! I have always loved trees and nature. I feel like this helps bring nature i doors. It lets in just enough light throughout the day if I keep them closed. I really like these curtains.  They are opaque enough to filter the sun and yet they let enough light come through so you can see the mural nicely during the day.  The material is sturdy and hangs well.  I like these curtains so much that I purchased some with other scenes on them, although I did wait for the price to come down.  I like to change my curtains up to change out my decor from time to time and these let me do that without paying an arm and a leg to do so. These curtains are amazing!!! The fabric is gorgeous. The design is exactly as shown on the website.<br>I LOVE THEM!!! Everybody come to visit me fall in love with this. Would buy again if needed.  Everyone remarks how nice and expensive they look and such a beautiful picture Awesome and just as good as images on post--not very often does that happen. Also much appreciated them arriving ahead of schedule. Looks awesome In person, I did not like the appearance. I seemed different when ordering it on the computer screen. It blocks the correct amount of light. The pattern and colors to not take over the room. The color is not at pictured. Its Green and white. One star because it at least has a good picture. Very good. money. Look Very  cheap. Iove theses drapes very different the whole family loves them. Absolutely love these curtains! Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not too babyish and not too formal. Work well in the spare bedroom. Great stitching and alignment. Sturdy material for a closet. Exactly what I ordered and expected.. Great item I love it! I love that the price was cheap and it was fast shipping as well! Beautiful curtains. Wonderful colors. Soft sheen to fabric. Love these curtains. Window curtians Nice rich color needs a better fabric looks to much like shower curtains Awesome thanks I love this curtain! It worked perfectly in my grand daughters room. Graphics are great &amp; they worked perfectly to cover a huge open closet Quality is excellent and the colors on the curtains are very strong! Vivid and true to life, makes me feel like I live on a farm in the city! Perfect in every way! You can\\'t see in @ night! It blocks sunlight. It is fine. It needs to be installed with widest curtain rolls and to be flat without wrinkles. My son likes it. He is 12 years old. Beautiful patterns, opague so you can\\'t see through them, good for any season of the year, I love my Ambesonne curtains.  Even bought shower curtains made by this brand. I absolutely love these curtains vibrant beautiful big great material not cheap at all I will definitely be buying more for my whole house would be Egyptian once again thank you so much I love it I put these in my baby\\'s room, they are nice and bright and super cute Luv it. Luv it luv it. No complaints. Hv a Blessed Day.  ❤❤ This is an amazing product. Just the right thing for the room that I had recently been redecorating. Great curtains with just an amazing view of the Eiffel tower. I was so excited for these curtains. However, the picture shows these curtains as floor length, and I received curtains that are mid wall length. I like these curtains because they offer privacy and still let light in. Very nice drapes/curtains...wife loves them...match our theme well..and from the outside they just look white..nice heavy material..not thin or cheap what so ever... Excellent and exactly what I wanted.  Really good quality too! Just beautiful. Gives my room a whole new look and feeling! Love them! They do not reflect what the picture shows.  The graphics are not  as deep. Used for livingroom La nitidez de la imagen es excelente, los colores, y brilla... simplemente perfecto. Have not use it.... the material is great. This was bought to use at a photo shoot but the customer went with another background I bought this for my husband photo shoot and the customers love it as they background. Great item NICE CURTAIN. fits as described Good<br>It stank and my opinion mold . it got wet dont know how. But it was small and easy to clean and remove. Ot stank so do outside Super cute! Looks great on my window I purchased these curtains for my sliding glass door I didn\\'t wat to put up blinds everybody has it and I wanted something different well I found it these curtains are beautiful at night we close it up and it is so private and it is beautiful to look at I highly recommend these if your looking for something different love them Very pretty to look at. But much more sheer than I expected. Almost like a shower curtain. I expected the quality to be much better considering what I paid for it They were much shorter then I was wanting. They are very nice, though. They do not wrinkle easily, which is a good thing. I have several themed room curtains/drapes of same brand. This one got a stain the 1st day and being a lighter color it did not come out well in the wash following instructions on tag. I left several messages with seller asking for advice and they never responded. I still love them and love how they bring the outside indoors. I love birds, so this set of curtains is perfect for my living room. Good quality! Picture was perfect on the material. Heavyweight quality material looks beautiful on patio doors in the dining room!! Wrong size sent. Didn\\'t like the digital computer rendition of leopard print---not like pictured at all!!! Bought these to hang in my sonâ\\x80\\x99s room. We didnâ\\x80\\x99t put them on the window though-replaces his closet doors with the curtains. They work great and fit perfect!! The length is shorter than the description, but overall my son loves the curtains. Beautiful drapery.  Great service. Sorry if pic quality is bad.  I bought these to cover a guest room window that has old mini blinds we usually keep half-raised so our cats can look out at our back yard.  Cat tv.  But the room is quasi-Mediterranean/Jungle/our stuff we just can\\'t use but part with,  if you get my drift,  We will usually leave curtains drawn to side to let in sun but when company is coming we can either completely raise blinds and close these making a golden glow  or at lower for a blue glow.  I don\\'t think they\\'d hold up to a lot of wear and tear but they do give our Texas rancher guest room a nice exotic feel while company sits and drinks coffee in the morning or settles in to watch some tv before sleep  The seam in the middle shows but doesn\\'t bother me at all,  Bottom line I love these.  They can quickly help make my quest room a nice other-place retreat.  I was torn between this one and the moon over the ocean ...  They help create an illusion.  If you can ignore the seam you\\'ll love them. This was a great quality product... absolutely beautiful.  I love the colorful fall season so this really suites my tastes.  Its not a cheap feeling material and the print is colorful.  Havnt tried it in the wash yet to see how bad it will bleed.  The sizing is acurate and it came with a nice little case to store it for when the season changes I liked these curtains. We have a large opening so we will probably have to order more. But they are lovely and shipped pretty fast. Although I did not measure the space ahead of putting up the curtains (too long, which is fine) the panels come as pictured... very vibrant colors, blocks out a lot of light. If you\\'re looking for complete darkness or noise cancellation, don\\'t get these. Very happy with this purchase. Pattern was too large for the small doorway I wanted to cover. Also the pattern had a fake - not realistic look about it. The marble design is not the best We are enjoying our curtains. We are using them as a room divider/privacy curtain. They are beautiful when light shines from behind. The sky looks like it is illuminated! Has white backside (pattern printed only on one side) and the image does not fit the actual pattern I love how my curtains match my sheet and bedspread( bought individually).<br>I have a closed blind on the left, almost closed on right, so you can see alot of light gets in.<br>I love love the pattern, the top of curtain could have a better trim, but overall, Im very happy! The curtains are nice but they had small stains at the bottom. Not as nice in person.  Didn’t use until I moved and there was an imperfect, but Amazon wouldn’t let me return. Over 30 days.<br>Wouldn’t recommend I just Love it!!!!!! definitely amazing excellent qualityð\\x9f\\x91\\x8cð\\x9f\\x8f»ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8cð\\x9f\\x8f»ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8cð\\x9f\\x8f» I have such a difficult time believing these curtains got any poor reviews. Firstly, how clever to make an image that spans across both curtains. It’s like looking outside a window into another world (a much more attractive/interesting one). I actually sew for a living, and am very impressed with the quality of these- great care was taken to make sure that the two curtains overlap in just a way so the picture isn’t interrupted. It’s been a long time since I’ve purchased curtains, and after a lot of looking in store and online, found these to be VERY reasonably priced. Overall an excellent purchase. The picture is beautiful, not faded or muted at all! They are room darkening, but not blackout. But gorgeous To save a lot of money on designing and dressing up my she shed, I use these curtains to hang on the back wall of my she shed. It is so cool as people look in and see a doc that appears to be one they could walk onto. Really cool. And easy to maintain. I use velcro to hang it up so it can be easily removed and washed. Great for she sheds to save money and ensure that material can be cleaned as needed. I ordered these curtains for my grandmother who is obsessed with clocks. Put them up waited for her to come home, and she LOVED them. Never say a 69 year old jump so high she nearly broke a hip. Quality is solid and colors are brilliant. Accidentally ordered a size to big but they\\'re great! I ordered this product and I loved it, nice material and very colorful. It was exactly like the picture. Love these curtains This item shown did not look like what I received. Nice product The drapes was very vibrant but where the leaves was supposed to be didnâ\\x80\\x99t even look like leaves at<br>All ! To me it look more like flames and a fire instead of leaves so Iâ\\x80\\x99m returning the drapes and I will be ordering a different one in hopes it will be better detailed These curtains are simply stunning and so realistic looking!  I live in sunny Florida and these are being used in a bedroom with a southern exposure.  They work really well as far as cutting down on the sunlight coming in through the two windows they cover.  Also, they seem to almost glow or appear to be lit up even on a cloudy or overcast day.  I don\\'t know if this feature is intentional or not but it really adds to their beauty!  It must have something to do with the material.  I highly recommend these curtains! Used as classroom decor-did not use as curtains but instead hung on wall-WOW! Received lots of compliments. The price is reasonable, the pattern is beautiful, and it covers up the window in my nursery. Very satisfied. If you like the print I recommend you go ahead and buy it. I got this and it just didn’t look like I was hoping it would. Not for my room. I am glad to have received More beautiful in person. Ordered 4 sets with different ocean scenery and all are great.  Pretty and bright scenery and match perfectly in the middle. Fast shipping The quality of these is much better than I was expecting. Highly recommend these beautiful curtains. Absolutely gorgeous and as I pictured it in my kitchen area leading out to my patio. Perfect for the sliding doors and lets in just enough light while maintaining privacy. Just looking at it makes me feel like I am taking a stroll in the woods right here in Arizona. Lol. Beautiful product. Aloha:) The material is thinner then how it appears on image and looks like a water color painted on the curtain up close, however the back drop looks amazing on camera and film so I’m happy The pattern is pretty.  Just like the picture. Love it Used these in my office to replace the doors.  I purchased two and they look amazing next to each other.  The center seam lines up perfectly so they hang nicely and I dont notice a split in the middle when closed.  Very good quality.  If there is a light behind the curtain (like from a closet or outdoor lighting) they light up the design beautifully. These look good in front of the sliding glass doors in my son\\'s apartment.  They are really cute and fun.  But you will need to put something else behind them if you need to block light.  The rod goes through a pocket so they are not easily opened and closed.  We put braided curtain tie-backs on each side to hold them open and drop the tie-back to close them.  The braids and tassels fit the motif of the curtains well. Beautiful I don\\'t know that I would purchase again, but they are nice.  I will never be able to recover the investment no one will pay more than $10 if I sell it, but that won\\'t be a for a long time from now. Really large curtains but perfect for what I wanted.  Quality is better than expected and almost 2 good for where they are being used.  Spent more than I wanted to but now and then, that\\'s what you do. Like it! More than one size to choose from. It’s soft and gorgeous! It adds so much to our room! Definitely suggest this! Just what I wanted I haven\\'t put these up yet, but just by looking at them, the quality is great. These are going to make my patio doors in my kitchen look so festive. Awesome curtains. They are lined. they keep the sun/heat out. Resolution of image could have been higher.<br>Picture  make image look like it is clearer than product delivered. Muy bonita de buena calidad Good quality material, thick but light comes through nicely Beautiful these look so good in my front room so much of feeling the warmth of Christmas thank you Beautiful, great quality material Beautiful and very nice material Looks great. Great for a nautical themed living room. Looks fabulous Curtain not as pictured. Shows 2 girls facing opposite directions. My curtains only had one girl. I received 1 panel with a girl and the second panel had her ponytail and chandelier. Uniqueness I like the look. Was hoping they would be a bit heavier These curtains are very beautiful well made.My  second  set only because my cats had claws on first. I would recommend these to all Husband likes these. I do not. They are not room darkening as someone else mentioned at all!! Only get them for looks not for darkening. Good Quality material Thick Bigger than I wanted even though I measured. I don\\'t have sliding glass doors, but expect to one day. I totally would recommend these to any one that does have sliding glass doors. The quality of material I believe is very good. Thick not too thick. The colors are nothing like the picture and the fabric was cheap. You could see the outline of the window behind the curtians. Even when it’s open it still looks good because you can still appreciate the design even though it’s bunched together unlike some large scenes I loved it. Beautiful The image is blurry, looks different than pictures and they are not blackout curtains at all. Very disappointed. Dining Room These are some awesome curtains best i have bought in years!! I bought these to be used over patio doors in our dining room. I am very pleased with the effect. I like the fact these are not blackout curtains and the overall effect is a diffused light coming through. The depth of the scene comes across nicely and works well as our living room and dining room are open space. The material is similar to a medium weight silk. The only caution I would give is to read the description of this item carefully and believe it when it indicates there may be a variance in length between the two panels. For the ones I received, one was 2” shorter than the other. For my situation, I just raised the hem on the longer side (as there was not enough hem to lengthen the shorter side). This was easier than trying to adjust from the rod pocket at the top. By using the hem, I just had to fold the hem over. If I had tried to lengthen the shorter panel at the rod pocket, I would have had to remove stitching and I was reluctant to do that. The finished length of the curtains is about 82”. ME ENCANTAN LOS PAISAJES. I absolutely love these curtains! They are thick and beautiful in my den! Highly recommend! High quality blackout style curtain.  Vibrant colors.  Great focal point to my baby room Love these even more that I thought I would! Perfect for my baby girls nursery! I took the panels and seamed them together as a double sided door. The print lined up perfect. Best Buy on a great printed curtain! home Used these for curtains for a dressing screen Beautiful, love it ... Perfect. I needed insulation from the Texas heat and privacy for the kitchen deck doors. These Ambesonne rustic curtains look great, compliment the floors, keep the heat out. I used a wide rod so I can slide the curtain out of the way when accessing the deck. The 90\" length looks great on the 9\\' wall. I got these for my daughter to use as her closet cover in her classroom.  They are peaceful looking and well made. I like the design - I bought the window with the beach scene.  The fabric is interesting - soft.  I don\\'t know how the colors would stand up to a lot of sun over time.  Some of the sewing has a bit of puckering.  I\\'m using it to divide a room - it\\'s private.  There\\'s just something about it that I don\\'t love though.  I just think some of the sewing isn\\'t up to standard.  But, it\\'s in a private area -  not many people will see it.  I do enjoy the scene. Just like picture. I was really disappointed in the curtains when I received them ... I was so excited when I found them and the way they looked online. Once I received them and hung them , I was very disappointed. It felt like a shower curtain material, the colors were lighter than in the picture , it was very cheap looking when the light shined on it. I just overall was very disappointed for the price of the item. Nice product. Very nice but not dark enough Love these. We bought these to cover the inside of a garage door that\\'s rarely used. I bought  these for my room, in replacement  for closet  doors, Item looks nice, colors are slightly  different,  more like a pinkish  color, And I wish they were wider,  overall  satisfy  with purchase Delivered my expected results. This is perfect for my entrance for the Alice in Wonderland party.  Thank you! Nice fit and looks cool from outside as well Great quality Just as described and easy to hem. Love them! the size was wrong the picture on one panel and the word paris on the other. I returned the curtains for a full refund Amazing curtains love them! Light does come in. But hung a double rod so can order blackout curtains.  Very happy with my purchase Very faded looking I dont see the geometric design but the curtains are nice but to pricey for product received Love these curtains! I am a professional photographer and purchased these to be used as a backdrop.  Love it for that! Brings nature right into my studio! These are absolutely beautiful in my classroom! My classroom windows are HUGE and over 70 years old! These windows cover them nicely and keep the room a comfortable temperature.<br><br>I dim the lights and turn on lamps in the classroom often, and with the lights off the constellations shine and sparkle through the curtain. My students and guests that come to the room all love it! I teach space science, and these curtains are one small way to get the kids interested in the mystery of the stars &lt;3 Beautiful looks like real wood Product is exactly as described. Would buy again from this seller! 100% happy! colorful Surprisingly pleased These are the nicest curtains I have ever bought. The material is a good quality and on the heavy side which I like. It may not \"block\" out the sun but I like how it keeps the brightness out while still letting light in. The colors match my kitchen perfectly and I couldn\\'t be happier with the purchase. Thanks. The print was WAY to large.  I thought the woodland characters were small... but they are 10-12” tall!  The picture is misleading.  I will be sending these back.  Also the material is too shiny Made an effiency on the intercoastal ( facing south.. darker in sunlight and 3:D larger room. Gonna rent at Madeira beach for $200 more now! Great product. Used it as a room divider. I feel like I\\'m fishing!!!!! So beautiful for the holidays! It\\'s just like they advertised it. Colors are great. Not Shear at all Very cute but I wished it came in 90 length. I needed a pop of color in my living room &amp; these curtains did just that! I get lots of compliments on them. They are a decent material for the price. I absolutely love these curtains! Very nice material. Great addition to my living room! L[ks great withe the lighted curtains underneath I love GrecoRoman design and these really standout! They\\'re thin so they don\\'t block sunlight very well, but the design is just so perfect! Super speedy shipping, not pixelated at all, bright brilliant colors A+++ seller! Will do business again. These are great Used as a backdrop for bowling booth at school fair! Looked amazing! Shipped quick. Love these curtains. The curtains were not black and white.they are dark yellow with diffent squares. I liked them.im going to keep them. I will have to reorder the black ones. Love the backdrop!! Not exactly what I was looking for but I found another use for it. I got New York Curtains, it is better than I expected. I really recommend. I read several reviews before purchase noting that the image on the curtains is blurry. It really is. Maybe if you\\'re 15ft away the curtains look ok, but close up, it\\'s like a bad watercolor where the edges have bled into the background. For something intended to look photorealistic, it just doesn\\'t work. This is a pity, because otherwise the material is a nice, reasonably thick fabric and does a good job if you\\'re looking for a light filtering curtain. Love having the \"picture\" rather than just curtains I love the design it has. Thank you very much Great to separate rooms with. Silky material easy to care for. They make my bedroom a relaxing place For Use in my living room I work at home and was looking for a curtain that I could put behind me when in video conferences, in order to avoid distractions from the rest of my home office. This curtain provides a great background image. I can joke about working at the beach, even though I live in the rainy Northwest! Fun drape. Colors are not as bright as thought but still a fun drape. Fun because this is not made to be in a formal setting. Great for kids, man cave etc. Keep in mind this has no ruffle above rod pocket, it just hangs. Paired with white drapes works for me otherwise not substantial enough. I was so pleased with the thickness of these. Thought they would be sheer, they are not and give privacy plus look amazing. Beautiful Love my curtains! It’s exactly what I ordered  Fast delivery, good quality and design as pictured. Can\\'t wait to use this curtain this winter season. How fun is this? its for kitchen door curtain for privacy and shade.  I like the design like looking out the garden. love looking at it. Like the item, just too transparent.  Am having someone seem in a backing to it, possibly a dark out backing. I liked the picture of the product, so I ordered it, but I never expected it to be so stunningly beautiful and doing exactly the shading job I needed these curtains to do. Worth the money. I wanted this curtain for a back porch. I had Invisoned a wood look. The pattern was less bamboo wood, and more yellow with a red stripe I had not noticed in the photo. Instead of a marble effect, the curtain looked like a dirty splotched panel. Beauty full Beauty full Able to create our own paradise.  Reminds us of our trip to the Polynesian Islands.  Gives our Florida Room a real tropical feeling. I turned them into hanging like a shower curtain Just added a slit and a hook. Beautiful curtain for my nieces room. Exactly what I wanted I am sorry I have to return it ,it doesn’t look like what is showing in the picture Absolutely love this curtain! Love the look of the curtains. Little expensive though. Color and prints are nice, but it’s to thick looking more like shower curtain Especial birthday sorprase I love we love so much I\\'m in love with my curtains. What great quality and beautiful they are so thick and soft Vivid color. Nice material. Vivid color. Nice material. These draperies are Soooooo BEAUTIFUL in my kitchen. I\\'ve  ordered one more 54x39 for my back door. 10 stars for sure. They are very shiny,soft and amazing to look at.  Lights up my entire kitchen. this is awesome, i truly feel like im in a cottage at the beach. the quality was way better than i expected. and the value depends on the size you get. i got a really long one so it was cheaper, i just put the rod up higher. (or you could hem it shorter) im waiting to find some more at the lower rate to get a different change of scenery. Son muy bonitas, si las recomiendo Oh my gosh,  I am so pleased,  such beautiful quality,  the colors are brilliant.  So happy I bought these Exactly as pictured, delivered as promised before deadline Very nice looks so realistic. Gorgeous!!!! Absolutely amazing buy! Are perfect excellent quality and material. Love it ! Very good I loved it! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a beautiful complement to my leaving room and itâ\\x80\\x99s exactly what we see on the picture. not quite what I was expecting.  I ended up giving it to my grand daughter. These are so pretty. I put them up in my bedroom and it\\'s so nice waking up to this beautiful scene and not bleakness and bare trees. I love these drapes! They are to expensive. They are very pretty. But it\\'s to expensive.  If be less money I will be recommended to friends Very disappointed. Not what I expected. Nothing like the description. The curtain design was completely different than the picture they have online. I will not buy from this company again. Nice heavy material, but a little thinner than expected. Still, it goes perfectly with my son\\'s room and provides adequate window coverage. I needed to visually open up the small bedroom in my tiny house. It works perfect for expanding the space! Beautiful postcard sooo real,,,,I traded it for a different beach,,,both are great fabric,,,,beautiful at sunset These curtains are beautiful I ended up sending these back. They are incredibly thin, the colors are not as strong as shown, the salvaged edge was showing around one entire seam, and the patterns didn\\'t line up. I was very disappointed. I never give bad reviews,  but it Does not look like the picture at all! Don’t waste your money Beautiful curtains, just not sure I should have spent that amount of money on them. Curtains are beautiful!! It brings a tranquil touch to our bedroom! Great ambiance, indeed! My curtains look nothing like this picture. The colors are different and I can\\'t see the guitar. The quality of the fabric is very good, however. window covering I personally do not care for these curtains. They feel cheap. They picture looks very dark but when they come you can barely see the picture. Not worth the money. Boys bedroom Nice to look at. Not high quality material nor do they block out much light smooth beautiful fabric, love the sunset beach look of it and it was nice and easy to hang and use so far Love can’t wait for Christmas to put them up. I’ve showed to my family and now they want to copy me. Beautiful curtains and they align well. Even with the folding the design comes out nicely. They are more elegant than I imagined. I thought they would be a bit cartoonish. They aren\\'t extremely elegant but definitely higher end. The colors are not as bright as they appear in photo. Cheaply made, garish colors, bad feel to the fabric, and the closer you get, the uglier it is. Big mistake. My only regret is missing the deadline to send it back because I was busy moving. Much better than expected! We are using them to cover a doorway that doesn’t yet have a door. From a short distance it really does look like a door. Plan to purchase more designs in the future. They r wonderful and really set the room off The picture make the curtains look long but they are not. It looks just like the picture though. great value Loved the Beach/Ocean theme it gives my room.  Very long.  I\\'ll have to adjust the casing at the top and hem to make it a good fit for my bay window.  Love it though! These drapes are very colorful,with a heavy material,and look great in my living room. The only thing I wished they had were wider. My windows are 140 inches wide,but these are still great,my husband is very happy,because they cut down all the sun light and he can now see his tv,lol I wish it was a more black out material as I imagined with the picture having no light showing through but I still like them. I loved everything about these gorgeous curtains Love the design and looks great. They allow some light through them but you cannot see through them. There a lil bit visible For the price and quality is definitely worth it. I recommend. I had been looking for just the right Asian themed curtains for years. As soon as I saw them, that was it.  The quality is excellent, coloring on point and I have received several compliments. Great value. Totally satisfied. Completed room decor Measurements were completely wrong had to mail back Just what I wanted. They are beautiful! Much prettier than looking at my neighbors house across the street. I bought these for an extra wide front room window (picture window with small sliders on each side, about 100” wide). These fit perfect!  I used a double curtain rod so I could close the barn door curtain in the evening, but have sheers closed during the day. The sheers are a tangerine color which brings out the lighter tans in the barn doors, but also adds a little color. During the day, the sun shines through the sheers and colors the barn curtains, but any other color will do the same.<br>The curtains are heavier than I anticipated. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase. Love it. Using  it as a room divider for the winter. Looks so nice I may use it year round. Was also delivered fast. Almost see through if not tacked to a wall. Back and trim are white. This is absolutely perfect for my serenity room.  Love it I wanted drapes to span the length of the bar in my family room.  These were the right length, but I needed them to be 42.  I decided to fold them in half and make an adjustment at the top, where they slide onto the curtain rod.  By doing that, I was able to have the wood pattern visible from both front and back.  I was able to do it without having to make any scissors cuts.  Really happy with the results!<br><br>The drapes are good quality for the price...there is a white fabric backing, so they are not sheer.  Happy with my purchase. Absolutely beautiful and perfect for my home. Nice material, Really pretty.  Very happy with this purchase I was a bit hesitant since there weren\\'t really reviews on this product, but it is absolutely gorgeous, nice quality and the colors are bright. Nice seams, plenty of room in the opening for the rod - absolutely perfect. Beautiful curtains, can\\'t wait to put them up for Christmas. Make sure you have a left curtain and a right curtain.  I hung mine up and have two left ones.  The board doors look ridiculous, and now I can\\'t send them back. Used for a room divider- it seems to have light of its own! Really pleased with the material Live it I love my curtains New York the city really come shining through with the sun line I\\'ve gotten so many  complements &nbsp;Love the curtains very much. Fit perfect for my window, looks good during the day and beautiful when music is going. Makes you feel like you are across the Brooklyn Bridge. gorgeous all Felt like shower curtain. I thought it would be bold and colorful. It  was just over all weak it seem it would be for a classy black woman but I think it should get hung up in a little girls bathroom as a shower curtain. As thick as the material is it could probably hold up in there. I hated the textures it feels and looks like a shower curtain. I was appalled that it didn’t look anything as advertised. I thought I would see bold murial like pictures. The color was weak the main features  that made up the theme was disappointing totally. I’ll just stick them in a closet and forget it. Great product. Exact as pictured.  I am happy with them The drapes meet all my expectations.  I hung them at my sliding glass doors in the dinning room and they have brought a holiday atmosphere in there. Really happy. These make a nice divider wall for my office in our unfinished basement. They keep warmth in too! Very happy. Very cool backdrop these are beautiful when the sun shines on them in the mornings it is just beautiful like looking out the window at a beautiful fall day . I really like these and will probably buy some more and take down regular curtains I have now <div id=\"video-block-R2AJYLSUYNQKHA\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sW9MRgN5S.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811WLF7iZVS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;They are beautiful! Thick, high quality bit pricey. Using in the living and dining room love them, match my theme These are in my dining room and I have a tablecloth that also has snowflakes on it. Everyone comments how fun it is. Absolutely beautiful and very good quality. I’m very picky and this turned out beautiful and is exactly like the picture. Very quick shipping. ALL PLUSES!!!! My son loves these. I also bought the shower curtain Gave these to a cousin for Christmas ,while visiting her in Jamaica,she went nuts about them,now she wants 2 more pieces. I was definitely expecting a better quality material for the price I paid. Very cheap looking. Beautiful well made great colors. Perfect! AWESOME &amp; the BEST ur money can buy n any of these kind of curtains &amp; way cheaper/better than any department store I added curtain clips to the top of my curtains so I could easily move the curtains to the middle each day to let the sun in and the dogs out and shortened them to cover my patio door.  It gives the door the touch of Italy and privacy I needed! Image is not quite as vivid or clear as that shown in ad.  Measurements were a bit off as well. Overall, not bad for two pieces but proves that you get what you pay for! I got these curtains to cover a work space area in the corner of my gym space.  They are long and they picture quality on them is very real.  The panels look just like a wood wall.<br>If you\\'re putting up in a living room i would recommend the more neutral colors; as my husband says they are too purple! Love this look...<br>  In my Family room it\\'s large and rustic looking...<br>With these curtains it make it look a little story tellers room...  All the Grand children love us to read story books in this room with a blazing fire and hot coco... Beautiful colors. Heavy quality fabric. So glad I purchased them. This need to have more block out effect to even see the pattern on the curtains, does not look anything like the pictures shown. Beautiful design and an easy way to add Christmas decor to a large space. The material was a bit thinner than I expected but otherwise as it looks in the photo These brighten the whole room! These curtains are fantastic! They\\'re nice and thick, and the picture is really like a photograph.  They\\'re room darkening,  but not completely light blocking.  If you want that you will need to put that kind of curtain behind these.  I didn\\'t want that, so they are hanging alone.  The backlighting from the sun makes the picture even prettier.  I bought 2 different images and love them both. Don\\'t expect a vibrant,  life like picture.  I\\'ve yet to see that on anything this size and price, including a shower curtain I purchased recently.  The back of the curtain is white during the day but definitely comes alive at night if you have a light on inside. I\\'ve attached pics, one from the outside at night. Pretty cool. Pleased. We live near the ocean, but have no ocean view. This was my answer. Since I only open it in one direction, I hand stitched the panels together in the center and created one sold panel. The quality of the graphic, and material was better than I expected for the price, and now I have my ocean view. It is especially convincing when it is backlit by the sun. I used a 1 1/4 in rod to support this drape set plus I sewed the 2 panels in center to cover my patio door. The material offers privacy and is of good quality. I like the beach scene too. These curtains are absolutely gorgeous! My mini is obsessed with them. They don’t have any light blocking to them, however I installed with a black out shade behind. Stunning curtains. Looks like a real scene in my living room. Crisp clean look<br> Glad I bought these These curtains are amazing. They make the room appear larger and allow some light to enter. You do have to hang them the way they are pictured with the brown horse to the left, or the horses heads will not be visible. Easy care &amp; visibly pleasing. I am very glad i have them. Absolutely beautiful curtains they are the perfect length for my sliding glass door gives my aviary bird room jungle feeling. Beautiful and great quality for the cost! They look beautiful in my Paris themed kitchen! Highly recommended I plan to buy these for all seasons. The Christmas ones were beautiful. Used in my massage room on two separate windows and it looks really good! Awesome quality. I get a ton of compliments. The graphics really make the waterfall Pop with even more with sun light I love my new beach curtains...and came on time Looks like you could walk right out the door to the beach! Just what I wanted. The colors are beautiful. Well made. Quality product Looks great although I had my mother hem and put a stitch across the top where the rod goes so there is a ruffle on top. Was too flat looking on rod without it. I was disappointed in the quality and would like to return it. Is it too late.  I have not used it but been too busy with my relocation. Good nan very happy with this product Material is that of a shower curtain and the one set they sent had no way to hang it. Very disappointed Love it They are wonderful.  Adds a perfect conversation piece to my dining room. I like the texture.  Using as part curtain part window extension. Nice Beautiful Beautiful Exactly what I was looking for. So pretty I love them so much! love these in my bedroom Love the view. Thought it was a bit pricey for the product. Love these curtains!!! They look just like the picture and are great quality!! The curtain is a nice quality fabric and the picture is beautiful but they obviously did some sort of photoshop on the ad pics. The curtains DO NOT look like that is person. You can see a lot of puckering on the seem where the two curtains come together. I have not tried to iron it yet, so maybe that will help. All in all I really do like the curtains, nice quality. Just don’t expect it to look like the advertised picture. I can’t say enough good things about these curtains. They are very well made and just what I was looking for. A wave of peacefulness sweeps over me when I look at them. I was missing doors on a small room I turned into an office. I highly recommend these beautiful curtains. I love the American cities with their shimmering buildings and I love natures\\' scenery but for some reason the enchanting look of these curtains was a inspirational appeal.  When I put them<br>On the rods I will put a picture on the site.  They are pretty wide so I am putting rods over my window. .  We purchased these curtains to cover a French door. It lets in the perfect amount of light. The picture on the curtains is perfect for the  beach theme in the room. Please note these are not black out curtains. The curtains are beautiful. Looking at them makes me feel like I’m on vacation. They are not thin but, they’re also not room darkening. Looks so realistic , but looks best when curtains dont have to be  pleated or bunched up to fit the space. Spread out it\\'s as if you can just walk in the sparkling water. Meh. The colors aren’t as vibrant as the pic. In the picture they look as if they were painted ...they actually look like a zoomed in fuzzy print and are pretty shiny .....good size and fabric though Wonderful imagery! It will bring your room to life. ❤️ Especially if you live in a colder climate.... take your vacation with just a glance Unbelievable!  I was going to spend a mint on a barn door. Then came across these curtains. I used one and everyone thinks it’s a barn door! Design was not crisp, like in the picture. Also, the material is too thin to be used for black out or thermal purposes. Looks and feels like a cheap shower curtain.  I returned it Used it for a cowboy themed party Good Vibrant and beautiful!!! Very nice. For the money The colors are vibrant and it blended in well as a room divider. Also, the fabric is nice and heavy. One of the pictures shows my real sliding door behind blinds for perspective. Thick and well made. The colors are very bright! I love the curtains very pretty And pleased with the colors Do not resemble wood, too silly. They really don\\'t block out the sun, they look great in the studio though. I painted my walls to look like clouds years ago but it turned into what looks like frosted glass. These curtains tie the whole room together. I\\'ll take pics later so you can see. the curtains look beautiful in my daughters room. The colores are bright and realistic. Nice! Our moon matches up between both curtains. Looks great! I liked the landscape, it feels as if I was actually there, Great quality Beautiful! The pattern is great for custom sizing and decorating our camper! Love the way these curtains look in the camper. Lots of compliments! So much better than plain curtains!! They glow rather than let the bright sun shine through. So beautiful, so colorful, good quality. Makes my home feel so much more alive. Doesn\\'t look as good as in the pics, faded colours these hippie/boho curtains are adorable! Adds a nice whimsical touch to my home. AWESOME!!! I have windows the width of my entire Living room, this pair combined with another similar pair, absolutely completed my holiday decor!! Guests couldn\\'t stop admiring them, and were shocked at how little I spent on them!  my only complaint, is wanting more choices in length, these were a tad too long for my windows, but i love them so much I couldn\\'t reduce the rating! am now looking to decorate other rooms of the house with Ambesomme Curtains, and replace  my living room ones! Product not as pictured. The picture online shows larger scallops and a single non-repeating rainbow design. The product I received has very small scallops with the design repeating many times. It is much busier than I hoped for.<br><br>The material is high quality. Shipping time was reasonable. I love Ambesonne curtains! I have them in every room of my home! I would have given these curtains a 5 star rating, because they are so beautiful, but one of the curtains was not stitched all the way across the curtain. It\\'s not that the stitching came out, it was never there. It looks as though someone  just stopped stitching 5 inches before they should have. Since these are satin and I\\'m not a seamstress, I have just hung them up as is.<br>  This would not keep me from buying more Ambesonne curtains though! I have another set on the way! Very cheap looking and you can see right through them. Terrible We love this curtain in out living room. The colors brighten up the living room due to not a lot of sunlight in our living room. Definitely worth buying and highly recommend to a friend or family. Beautiful but the colors didn\\'t match my study Completely beautiful curtains! I am extremely happy with them and the high quality material! I love these shower curtains!  They add a bit of intrigue and elegance to my bathroom! The Christmas scene is beautiful, well worth the money itself. Material is thin, so would keep out drafts/cold air very much at all. I loved these. However the description doesn\\'t mention GRAY  DESIGNS! Had to return because of that!! This arrived same day and is absolutely amazing!!! My fiancé proposed to me on the Brooklyn Bridge. We live in Texas and he\\'s always missing home(Brooklyn), this satisfies both of us!! The drapes where so wonderful. Great quality, the color was poppin. I used these as a back drop for a football theme babyshower. Everyone loved it. Great buy! Great. More complements than you can imagine it was perfect to cover my bedroom wall with 2 windows. it was also a great price. Love the look and quality of this curtain for our basement sliding glass door. Highly recommend if it goes with your walls and decor! Nice I love these curtains Loved this Christmas curtain, my first one. It fits perfectly well . They are awesome!! Product was way better fabric than expected.The price was great. The look is exactly how it appeared in the pictures. And its a no wrinkle Fabric! Love my purchase! Curtains were uneven and patterns didn’t line up correctly . Color didn’t match post This curtain was way bigger than I imagined but it makes my twins room look amazing. I definitely think it’s worth the price. The quality is great, and overall just a great buy. Really makes the wall stand out It looks fine<br>Have not hung it yet This is an amazing product. It has changed my living room decorum from dull to charming! Thank you I like it because my children love it. These are well-made, of a fairly thick single layer but with nicely sewn hems, etc. The only strange thing is that there is an overprinted pattern of diagonal wavy lines. This looks great, but in certain lighting conditions, where they overlap the black bars, this makes them look like the curtains are wrinkled.<br><br>Note that these are not blackout curtains. The shape of the windows definitely shows through.  If you want total light blockage, a second rod with lightweight blackout fabric is required.<br><br>BEWARE of imitations! This pattern is available on a range of items, including duvet covers, pillow cases, and more. I purchased a couple of shower curtains that appeared to have an identical pattern, but the blacks were brown and the  cool zig-zag strokes where just solid irregular shapes. I love the idea of having a mural in my wall, and these do a wonderful job of it.  They look amazing under low light.  My only complaint is that the shiny fabric looks cheap when the lights are on.  You can see every crinkle and the colors get muted. A matte fabric would have been nicer. I absolutely love this curtain set. They fabric quality is excellent and the colors are vivid. It is much better than I expected. I would highly recommend this. I turned my living room into a spring time Forrest with twinkling icicle lights, garland, flowers, a water fountain... but something was missing.  THESE CURTAINS!! Now my living room look is completele! Very cute! I set it up as a front curtain for my office. Yes, it is white not red, just looks red from my sheer red curtain behind it. Heavy duty product. Beautiful curtain ! Nice printing on design . Good heavy duty quality. I used it to hide some hideous shelves in a small apt Just what I wanted These are heavy duty light blocking curtains that have received lots of compliments. I was reticent to buy these curtains , but I decided to get them anyway since I can always return them. I have them on my room and they are lovely. They material is thick as most customers mentioned and the are well made. They fall straight to the floor very gracefully. I like them because they desing is very relaxing and give me piece of mind. They only thing I noticed is that the light filters through in the moorning  but this is to be expected due to the nature of the desing itself. My sister liked so much that I will purcharse another set for her for Christmas. I admit that I did not expect these curtains to be as nice as they are.  The fabric is vibrant and smooth, and they look fabulous in the room. They don\\'t wrinkle, and I am hoping that they launder well when that becomes necessary. I intend to purchase more of these curtains in different patterns. These are better quality than I thought they would be. They look really nice on the window and still let in a little light. I put them in my office and have received many compliments on them. The vivid colors and sharp patterns are exactly as advertised. The curtain material feels of great quality and was thick enough to provide the privacy I was looking for to partition my room.  I wish I had more windows just to purchase more curtains. Absolutely in love with this!  Fast delivery, so beautiful! Thank you The waterfall curtains I ordered are very beautiful durable and lightweight Love the design on the curtains, however could have been just a bit wider. But they do work for where there were intended for. The length of the curtains are just the right length for the place they were installed at. I purchased 2 of these in different colors I am very disappointed both  heavy  polyester shiny and looks cheap. The one in color was almost 3xthe amount of this one. I am very very disappointed. Very good Just adds the touch the dining room needed Ugly Excellent material, great length, great vibrance and saves me from having to find a painting to tie the room together. living room  pretty thru sunshine very nice. make child room brighter These were beautiful! Great, cool look Small Very pretty curtains Excellent product and delivered within two days! These Curtains are very nice and I just love the design I am sure to receive many compliments. Priced very reasonable, material is nice, sent well packaged and they arrived one day earlier that\\'s a plus. A little less colorful than it appeared in the listing but still very pretty Very thin looks thinker in picture Good quality I am so impressed with these curtains, that I wished I owned a house with many more windows just to hang more of these BEAUTIFUL scenic veiws! From the moment I enter my family/TV room I feel transported to a vacation atmosphere!<br>The curtains came nicely folded which leaves the creases. I took the time to mist down each panel, followed by dryer steaming them (1 by 1) &amp; then ironing the curtains with an iron having my heat protector cover on my iron to protect the fabric. I steamed ironed the back side first and then the front side. BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL!<br>They brighten my room, with privacy because they do have a very nice white reversed side and yet gives a wonderful light through the beautiful beach landscape. Just as if I owned ocean front property and I could step out and onto my own get-a-way! The fabric is smooth with a nice curtain weight. The 3-D image.... Perfection!<br>The stitching on the seams were a little tight even after ironing, so, I put those heavy magnet clamps (the ones to hold papers on your frig) and placed them on the bottom hem under the stitching for a couple of days. That solved that issue for me. Did I mention BEAUTIFUL?!?!?!<br>Only wish I had more windows!! Pretty in my living room bay window.  Fits shorter than stated by about 4 inches on each curtain.  My window has a gap where the curtains don’t meet but when the sun hits the curtains the trees really look alive Our house is decorated in beach theme.  We got these for the living room windows.  They look great and the material is well made.  The color looks just like it did in the picture.  I am very happy with this purchase. I was a little unsure of this material when I opened the package… I put the curtains up and couldn’t believe it… I stood back and I have never liked curtains more! Material was amazing I thought it might be staticy  and  attract animal hair but it does not! I love these curtains. The colors are vibrant and the material used provides the perfect coverage and privacy. The tropical design looks like a mural to me. I am truly happy with this purchase. Not high definition Had some sort of not stains but can’t explain but you can see the shades when the suns is up Looks awesome in our home theater Look Awesome LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!! They match my furniture set and the light shines through between the trees, makes me feel like I\\'m back in the woods at home. Super nice quality too!! Loved this I love them. They look great Nice! I have received many complements on them. Not what you see in the picture. Really bad quality Looks like you\\'re walking toward the shire... Good quality. Used as a wall mural They are too long weight These are awesome! Made the living room feel like being at a nice tropical paradise when there is no money to go on vacation.  Great for a backdrop for photographs too. These are probably too expensive for their worth, as the material isn\\'t linen, but the design is very beautiful and feels very durable. I wanted a forest theme for my meditation/reading room, and this fits perfectly. This is perfect in my bedroom where the closet doors were coming off the track. This vase my bedroom so bright I love them and the quality is so great Uneven cheap Used as background for our wedding.  Looked awesome On sliding in living room, awesome product Awesome, love them Beautiful Sooo pretty, if only I had the sense to measure the length! I WILL figure out a way to hang them one way or another! Put on windows in home office. Really brightens up the room. I sent this back the same day it arrived.  It doesn\\'t look like the cool photo, it looks like a blurry toddler blanket and hardly worth the mega bucks to buy it.  Not at all like the product photo. These are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! EXACTLY as pictured! Heavy duty curtains!! Not thin! Everyone loves the curtains I purchased for my sons nursery! They really add that special extra touch to the room I must like these I purchased 4 sets<br>Worked great in our Newhouse until our blinds get installed Helped darken the room. Cute, but wish they were double sided. I was disappointed because they were not offered in a 45 length. I had to have them professionally shortened. The fabric is very nice. I absolutely love these curtains!! Could not be happier! They look fantastic and add such character to my home. I have 3 sets on 3 windows. The material is heavy and durable. Not at all the quality I expected for for the price. I would recommend these to anyone considering! They don\\'t let as much light in as I thought they would.  They are very pretty tho. Very sturdy material. Curtains are well made. Material is quite nice. Great match for the bedspread. I absolutely love this curtain. Far exceeded my expectations. Picture is blurry.  Its like they enlarged it too far and the pixels are too blurry. Very well made Love these! Just perfect Just as described Great deal. Bedroom I get so many compliments! Exactly what I was looking for. Wide, perfect length, and affordable. Blocks out enough light from my patio. Wish they were blackout but other than that I can\\'t complain. Disappointing. Not as pictured. Window to return closed too soon. Cool curtains for my teenage son. I like the quality of there curtains.  This is my second order. Very nice. really gives the room a bright flair without looking tacky. Material is heavy enough to hold the shape without bulk. It completes a space, Its stunning . Exactly what I was looking for Didn’t like looks like a screen Prettier than I expected. Using them for a room separator. It Really Does Take Me Back To The Beach , These Curtains Are So Cute It Was Hard For Me To Chose . I bought these for my boyfriends music room and he just loves them I love it<br>Its beutiful Was for the french door but I use in the bedroom They look great! I love these curtains great picture vintage looking , material thick enough where you cant see through but at the same brings in a lot of light. Would  definitely order again. My son loves them.  I purchased this for my son\\'s room, who loves basketball.  These curtains fit with his décor and looks very good. It does not look like the picture it is cheaply made and not worth the price at all. Curtains are awesome and make my living room pop.  Everyone that has seen them loves them.  Couldn\\'t be happier Very nice curtains. Very nice size. These are so pretty!! Looks like picture I ordered 2 sets to divide a part of my large living room off temporarily I was hesitant that they would look cheesy but actually they look pretty good even realistic in the dim lite I got 2 different sets and the colors and doors matched up nicely. These curtains are great quality. Love them. I have them hanging in my garage to cover some shelves. I have a woman cave and these add character to the space. I may be another panel to hang across the water heater. A little pricey, but so worth it. Bought this to divide a room for my daughter to craft in and have received so many compliments. Very beautiful scenary. Nice fabric. Slides easily on curtain rod. These curtains are actually better than I expected. The material is thick and the design is amazing. The colors are not as poppin as I thought but I still love them. Its beautiful.. i used it in my living room onmy great big window and at night looking in from the outside with light on it looks amazing too. Many many compliments. Love  the curtains just the right touch for my music<br>. Room Looks great in our room, good material, great design This is not really black Not the exact same color It’s a little glossy looking but over all they blend well with the look I wanted. Heavy stiff material so they don’t hang as smooth as I would of liked. Bought to hide an area of the basement. Nice quality. Very nice way more than I expected them to be. I would recommend them The color was too dark for the room Go\\'s well in my room , beautiful, but let\\'s to much light in. Very Pleased! Arrived Quickly as described and Beautiful Quality! #Perfect I love it. It adds so much color to my home The color in the picture does not even remotely reflect the actual product.  The country pine trees should be more of a taupe/gray/smoke/tan color.  Not so.  Totally lavender including the background.  So weird.  Returned immediately. I absolutely love them!! I absolutely love this product. I am happy with the quality, measured correctly and is very pleasing to the eyes They brightened up the entire room and fit perfectly Awesome curtain especially for the price. This is one of two sets of Ambesonne\\'s Batik pattern Curtains. I\\'ve had them for over a year and they are still as lovely as the day I bought and hung them up. I did wash them in white vinegar before hanging to set the dye. (A trick my mother taught me decades ago.) After drying on air dry, I used a warm iron to remove any wrinkles.<br><br>You will love the colors of these curtains. My color scheme for my open floor home has the blue and oranges of both sets of curtains. This particular set is in my living room while the other is in the dining room. There was no funny smell and they arrived onetime undamaged from the seller.<br><br>I did not hang them on the rod, but used curtain clips which I find reduces the wrinkling of the curtain.  It also allows me to open and close them with little wear and tear.  All and all, I LOVE these curtain and LOVE AMBESSONE!! Fits good Just the look we were looking for.  Thick, sturdy curtain with vibrant colors. Yes, the backing is white, but it did not create a color difference from what is pictured. I\\'m busy looking for my next pattern, and will definitely order from Ambesonne again! The pattern was colorful and lovely the fabric however was like that of a low cost silk dress.  Sort of sheer and cheap looking. Wish it was fuller Absolutely stunning Great easy gift for all I Love it! Have it at my laundry room in lieu of doors. I’m sure it will look even better once the wrinkles fall. nan Such a Pittsburgh fan and this is exactly what I was Looking for! Great material and fast shipping! Super happy! Perfect SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL - VERY WELL MADE AND PRICE WAS GREAT I used it for a music event and it was lovely!! Love them! I\\'m only using one of the two pieces.<br>I ironed both but ultimately chose to use just the one, on my bedroom closet door.<br>It works for me. I like it.<br>I like the silky, yet firm texture.<br>I like the way the closet light shines through it when it\\'s closed.<br>I like the design.<br><br>The order came complete and in new condition.<br>No issue with purchase or packaging or delivery or billing. All good. The material feels like paper. But the colors are bright. It is not a darkening curtain so a lot of sunlight will come through the window. Love these curtains! They look so pretty. But, if you\\'re looking for blackout curtains, these are not the curtains for you. Lets all the light in. Not a problem in our Paris themed room. We hung blackout curtains underneath. Really fun and good looking for our movie room! These curtains are beautiful! Love them. I have them hanging in my garage to cover the door. I wasn’t expecting them to be such great quality! These are absolutely AWESOME!! Completed my Holiday decor perfectly. My only complaint is I wish you offered other lengths, these were a tad too long, but these so beautiful, I couldn\\'t reduce the stars for it! My son is very into space and loves these curtains. They\\'re definitely not black out curtains as the light still shines in through the window in daylight. However, they work well for keeping the headlights from the highway from waking him up at night so they\\'re fine for us. Looks great in morning when sun hit the back. They are thin so you need a shade behind. The colors are not bright. It’s not a picture it’s a curtain. We love the look Love these curtains! Makes me feel like I\\'m at the beach year round! perfect for my RV and easy to use on the road or at home Great product Product definitely does not look as good as the picture, I\\'m not hanging this up. I bought this for my son, a guitarist, for his birthday. He loved it. He works third shift and sleeps during the day. So an extra layer to block the sun is great by him and that it is a guitar motif makes him very happy I got two of the same curtains. But I did buy them used and about 50% cheaper. They are nice curtains though. It took a few weeks hanging for the wrinkles to fall out. I wasn\\'t in a hurry. I can\\'t speak for durability, as it has not been cleaned/washed yet. I needed to alter the width and lenth of the curtains. It was a challenge but the fabric quality helped and the overall scene was not compromised. This is a quality  and really nice looking product.  It arrived on time and was as described.  i recommend he seller and the product. Love it! Exactly as pictured. Brightens up the room.  Thank you! I purchase it for a friend in Cuba. They loved it. Awesome I am so pleased with these curtains! They are very beautiful &amp; well made. The fabric is good quality, &amp; they look great overall. Ive enhanced my living room. It feels so cozy and tropical eve though I live in North winter country.I love the ocean and this curtain acts as a mural. I’ll buy more for other parts of my home. These are amazing the quality is wonderful. I honestly would\\'ve paid double Loved the country look I purchased these for a back room.  I love the ocean and thought, \"Why not?\"  Of course, they aren\\'t like the real thing, but they are fun.  I did worry that they would be a bit see-through; that is not the case.  Well done. I was very disappointed the fabric was a heavy shiny polyester it looks cheap. Looks totally different from the picture. Very unsatisfied. I feel the product looks nothing like photo. It is so abstract and vague it hardly appears to be \"a forest\"...VERY MISLEADING! They wasn\\'t what I expected I love the way it look For the baby’s room. Great quality. Was not as realistic as the picture. Disappointed. Well, they ARE polyester...the finish is just fine, but not up close. It has the appearance of silk, and will pick easily if anything rough rubs against it. The background is not beige, rather off white. Some of the colors within the pattern are very pretty, a few are slightly \"off,\" as in the pink used, it\\'s a candy-like pink. I used these in a kitchen with tall, nearly floor to ceiling windows, painted light sage green with white trim. They are especially great for spring/summer months; I plan to change them out for fall and winter. I just purchased another pair for a fully gathered look. I have them hanging in my dining room on my sliding glass door. I love looking at them.  Reminds me of being at the beach. Exactly as pictured, but the quality of the drapes was beyond my expectations.  I really nice addition to my bedroom ensemble. I bought these curtains for a bedroom that I had converted to a walk-in closet/dressing room. They are a beautiful focal point of the room. They are high quality material and add an elegant look to the space. I love these curtains. The print is beautiful, and they\\'re durable (i bought a different print 3 years ago and they\\'re in excellent condition). It changes the look of the whole room. So, I pictured more of a general image of a mermaid. There looked like it was a photo of a real woman. Creepy. I don’t want some strange woman mermaid in my house. The quality was good, so I was disappointed with the image and sent them back Well..I will be returning the curtains immediately. I ordered the space decor curtains because if the beautiful purple and blue colors.... That\\'s not what I got at all. The set the was delivered had not a drop of purple and tons of green and white. I\\'m thoroughly disappointed  Very cheap but I made them work and I love how it fits perfectly in my living room. Its not a true red more of an orange red color Gorgeous... instant zen... just FYI... they are very long in length My wife bought these for our new house. I wasn\\'t a huge fan at first...it was just so different than you\\'re used to. Now I\\'m into it. EVERYBODY mentions it. Beautiful! I absolutely love these curtains, I did purchase them on sale and they are amazing. The original price is a little high but will buy more if they go on sale. Bright colorful These are amazing! Opens up my small bedroom and I put warm curtain lights over :) love them! I love this. My son is so happy for this curtain. One day I will buy another one. I feel like I\\'m out in the woods - a great addition to my windowless classroom.  Well made and beautiful, true-to-life colors, These look great . not cheap looking . Will get another set Curtain are not as color detailed as in the picture . Compared to the picture, the real curtains look less detailed . Nice! I have received many complements on them. Just a little short, but I luv it! I have  no problem I love it it was worth the money These curtains are of beautiful quality. There is even a white lining on the rear side. The trees, coloring and layout are very natural.  They hang beautifully.  It is like looking in the forest. I am buy this again( right now)  WOW !! I\\'ve become an avid collector of these curtains. They are so detailed and vibrant. As someone who can\\'t afford to travel this is the next best thing. Wherever you want to go on land or sea Ambesonne will take you there! Exactly as described and on time. Good seller. Thank you. I\\'m actually quite happy with these. The screen printing is nice and the fabric is of decent quality. I paired them with a set of sheer valences and the effect is lovely! Waited till I found a sale. It was worth it! Curtain is very pretty and fits in well with my zen themed room! I was surprised by the quality..I love it. It looks good, well made, does what I wanted. Very nice These curtains... I\\'m so glad I decided to google \"Christmas Curtains!\" They look great and add some whimsy to our dogs room. I cannot begin to describe how beautiful these curtains are in person! They let plenty of light in without being able to see through into the house at night. I will be purchasing more for the front windows of my house, the ones I purchased are for our balcony door. Love love love!! Omg...love these!! The material is very high quality! The kind you would expect from a drapery or high end retail store. The image is pictured EXACTLY as received! And the price makes them a steal! The picture is brighter and more vivid than the actual curtain, however it is of a half decent material that I feel they last awhile. They block out the light and view inside at night. All in all they get 4 stars Very nice if your thinking about purchasing. Don\\'t hesitate get them they\\'re gorgeous. I have been using for three years now,and look like I just got them. I enjoy the way they look on my sliding door when curtains are closed even when open Ok Love this and was my main addition to decorating this year. Beautiful curtains, well made. Just like it looks- awesome!! This is just perfect for my baby’s room! It brings character and charm to the room! Great value for the money definitely added a bright warm atmosphere to the home Gorgeous as well as the material Looks really cool in my son\\'s room. Great buy. I bought it for my granddaughter and she loved it! It is very relaxing and beautiful horses, it looks natural. Love it Not sure how the product will do in the future when it has to be washed and it is darker than I t hought it would be but am still very satisfied with it. Very pleased.  I was skeptical to order on line and was happy when they arrived with a nice quality and true to size. Worked great for photo spot too. Used them for my sliding glass doors, beautiful! good fabric. warmed the room Love It I thought these were BLACK OUT curtains. I have pictures of the curtains during the day and night.... Ironed and wrinkled..... Sunlight and regular light.... I\\'m not able to enjoy the bottom of the curtains, however, they are alright overall. Good quality. I had to purchase black out blinds to go with these. That is the downfall. Got these curtains in the birch pattern. Was under the impression they were going to go down to the floor like in the picture, but they actually just hit the bottom of the window. Not a dealbreaker, but was a little disappointed when they arrived and were shorter than expected. They are also a little thinner than I’d like. Used them in a nursery. placed it over double windows. looks great when the sun comes up. Would recommend to everyone! excellent curtain, well made and excellent material as well It is as in the picture Perfect size and looks amazing in my living room, almost appears like your looking outside! I waited all week for these curtains, I ordered the first pair and had to return due to the wrong length so I reordered the right length, the curtains was not to my satisfaction but I’ll just keep them. I didn’t like the idea of a line in the fabric on one side, for the amount of money these curtains should have been flawless. It’s a gray day a little after 14:00 maybe I’ll be impressed on a sunny day. Haven\\'t decided if I like them or not. I\\'ll have to do some improvising way to much white for me. But they are pretty Great Perfect for our nursery! Love them! These look fabulous over my patio doors leading to the workshop from my Saloon/Gameroom/all time FunRoom! Don’t buy My granddaughter loved them! Very refreshing.. Summer ready.. Prettier in person cos you can\\'t see the pretty blue water it jus look white in the pic.. Got it hanging on the wall to cover the closet door to give the wall sum use.. My flat screen sits in front of it.. I put my couch in front of it sumtimes..  Very pretty got a pair for every season.. Great quality product.  I would clearly order it again.  The only problem we had is that either we measured wrong or it\\'s not as wide as they say. I solved that by putting a black curtain on each side which actually made it look better.  The black really popped the colors in this. It\\'s lovely. Likes :<br><br>Material , texture , design is sharp , colors can be identified , ideal height , ideal width<br><br>Dislikes : I would like it to have loops to run through the hanging pole / bar<br>It’s kind of hard / hive a little friction moving Material on these are fantastic! Love them❤️❤️❤️ I love these curtains they looks great in my she shed Love it looks just like picture made my room look beautiful It really really smells like bug spray - it is off-gassing something toxic!  Its still outside and been through rain storms. Its been a week. The smell was not going easily. I could wash it I guess, but it won\\'t have that fresh look it came with then. After the storm today, it may not look fresh either - I will check it tonight. That said, it is SO GORGEOUS, BEAUTIFUL AND EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR. I love these curtains, Excellent Quality. 5 Star. I bought these for my son’s room, goes great with his Egyptian theme. Nice for the price. Good material. Perfect for his room...even though he 28 years old...He Loves them...Thank you Not happy with these at all. They aren’t “silky” to the touch... they feel like crisp cheap polyester. The folds are still in them, even after washing. They seem like a huge fire hazard. They’re thin and tacky and shiny like plastic. I bought them for a nursery but now regret not returning them, as I won’t be using them. They may work as a picnic blanket or, I don’t know, a drop cloth for painting. Not at all what I was expecting after reading reviews. Cheap and worth maybe $15. They’re cute otherwise... if made out of literally any other fabric but cheap polyester. The coloring seems to be as described and the material is not too heavy or too light.  If your looking for something sheer, this is probably not going to be what you want. It filters light in. I actually like it because it is a peaceful scene and when the sun shines on it from an angle it almost looks like sun rays are shining on the water.  Glad I purchased these. I love this! I bought it to use on an extra big front window instead of a bathroom. Won\\'t block daylight or but that\\'s ok. It\\'s heavier than a lot of shower curtains but thinner than I like so hung a solid brown thinner curtain made of the same material behind it. The 2 together blocks the sun well. Everyone says it looks awesome. Would definitely do it again. Product dimensions were exactly how they were described and exactly what I was for. Love the creativity it brings to the room. A bit lighter when compared to the posted picture, but otherwise excellent quality and design.<br><br>Packaging was tampered with prior to me receiving the package from my yard. Otherwise, 5 stars. Ambesonne has always provided the best reproduction of photographs/imagery to all of their products.  Purchased this African inspired piece for my in-laws guest bedroom.  Both the workmanship and quality of the fabric were superb.  The colors were vibrant and beautiful!!!  However, the overall pattern overwhelmed this small space. Looks amazing in photos and really cool in person! I bought this to put up in my classroom to cover up exposed shelves. I don’t have any windows in my class, so I wanted to bring a touch of the outdoors in. I love it!! Not a total black out but blocks most of the light fabric seems quality and the picture is enjoyable The rich colors are most visible at night. During the day the sun streams through making it look lighter. Nice, changes depending on sun. Beautiful inviting scene. These are great. Light coming in behind them looks like the view from a deer stand. Very nice.  Well made. This is my second purchase of the , iGoth Castle. I like to create the illusion of space in my tiny aboad, and this moon lite view is perfect. Its Awesome! It looks cool ! We actually used these on our outdoor canopy. We are about to order 2 more sets because we love them so much. They dry really quickly when it rains. These give off an amazing tropical vibe. We’ve had several parties already. I do, that\\'s why I have mine up as the curtains in the bedroom makes me feel safe when they are closed off to the world. Good look very large will say takes up the whole wall and I mean the whole wall. Awesome product and fast delivery! Still different from the imagination, but it is acceptable. Love the look and as described! Do wish they were thicker. Fast shipping ! What a disappointment that they do not do free returns. These curtains are beautiful. I recommend them for sure Beautiful The product was just as described. I really like the material. I can\\'t wait to put them up in our beach house!! So beautiful over my sliding glass doors!! Im in love! It looks grate in my room was easy to put up Great quality fabric, not light tight, but heavy and blocks quite a bit.  Also good at keeping drafty windows contained. This curtain is beautiful, non-translucent and just what I wanted the quality was very nice.  were to big for what I needed. Very ugly. The pic looks good, but when received, color was not as dark. Love this in my husband mancave and he loves it will order again It was a lil bit to long but that ok I love it I love it Not what I expected Beautiful -- love the way they soften the room! Nice colers Maybe because of photoshop, the colors in the photo are very rich.  Live in person without the effects of the camera the colors aren\\'t as vibrant on this pattern so I took a star off of this 5 star product because of that.<br><br>I love the Ambesonne brand of curtain because they have so many patterns to choose from and the quality very good.  The material is opague which could keep nosy neighbors from looking in and seeing right through them especially at night.  Also, the pattern shows on the other side which is very nice because I have this one hanging on a doorway between two rooms.  Because it shows on bothsides, not as rich but not so faintly either, I don\\'t need to hang a curtain on the backside to show in the other room the curtain divides.<br><br>They\\'re costly but because they\\'re worth it, I highly recommend this brand of curtain.  Bought and received a few today because with the season change, the full length 84\" winter Ambesonne\\'s I already have hanging had to come down to get replaced with the 63\" length.  The advantage of that allows air to come in through the window under the curtain. LOVE THE PATTERN. NYLON MATERIAL SEMI-TRANSPARENT. (REMINDS ME OF A FABRIC SHOWER CURTAIN) GREAT SELECTION, OVER PRICED IN MY OPINION. HANGING SHEERS BEHIND THIS FOR A FULLER WINDOW TREATMENT I’m pretty thrilled with these curtains...unexpectedly heavy and nicely made. I almost didn’t buy them as I thought the price seemed a bit high, but now I see they’re worth it.  I think they look better in person than in the photo. I plan to buy another pair for a different room. My son has a gothic / medieval theme in his room, and this curtain set takes up one whole wall!  It seems and looks like you are actually in a castle.  We got a smaller set (same brand) for his other window, and the knight we placed in front of that one completed the look! It is high quality and beautiful. It is made from a thick, sturdy material and not flimsy at all. I love these curtains. The design is detailed, the colors stunning and it has two layers for blackout privacy protection. Loved the graphics. Wished fabric was heavier.  Great price. Cool Fast shipping, beautiful colors, picture is clear and the continuance of the picture meets perfectly in the middle. I ordered 4 different sets of different ocean scenery from  this seller and all four sets  are perfect. I didn\\'t check the durability box because I won\\'t know until I need to wash them, which when it is time to do so I will use the delicate cycle and hang dry Matches my western theme backyard. Color and quality is great I loved everything about this curtain.<br>I actually  put industrial 10lbs 4.5kg<br>Heavy duty Velcro ,and put  on the opposite wall( it looks like wallpaper,love it) from my belly cast iron<br>Stove,it looks amazing!! It gave it the extra rustic cozy feeling. Highly recommended.thank you. Very good. I use this to decorate my sushi restaurant and i like it. Love them Not at all as it appears online Awesome country look Awesome beautiful and fun! Great The design is beautiful, but overpriced for what you get -- a printed piece of fabric, with remnants of the printed manufacturing guides on the back margins. The design also appears more horizontally stretched out than the example photo for the item depicts. Also there were a number of small stains on the white fabric, some of which look like they could be blood. All in all it\\'s disappointing since the product listing makes it look better than it is. Kickass PRODUCT  !!! BOUGHT 4 SETS ALREADY !!! MY RANCH HOUSE IS COMPLETE  !!!! LARKUSMC ** Good Awesome make your room come alive..if you need to add pop into your rooms windows this product is for you I love the picture itself- very pretty!<br><br>Material is on the cheap side and lacks the brilliant color quality  as shown on site...<br><br>However I definitely don’t think it was worth the price so I won’t be ordering again Changed out my old vertical blinds with these drapes on my patio door. I like the coastal look. Sewed the 2 pieces together and wish they were easier to open and close. I still like them as they will be easier to clean. The picture does not match the product that was sent. I\\'m in love with my new curtains. They are very high quality, the image is clear and not blurry, satin finish but thick material. I love it. Really great product. Print was nice and decent weight to the fabric. Used it for Charity Halloween function last year! Loved it! Absolutely beautiful... The quality is great.I will be ordering a set for bed Room. Well made for the price... The Stewart tartain plaid is NOTHING like plaid. It would be best described as a pixelated African print. Very cheap looking and nothing like I was expecting. The edges curl inward on one panel and outward on the other with a gape in the center. Magnetic weights connecting the center seam would be a great way to fix the gap. Love love. They look great on the window Beautiful! Super long but beautiful! Nice color This curtains are amazing. It looks so beautiful perfect math with my decoration Nice thick curtains! Print is crisp, great addition my son’s superhero room! product was exactly as described,  we are happy with them Just great and great quality Love it. Perfect for vintage theme. I am very pleased  with the curtains  they look awesome  I have a log house they go perfect in it Thanks Beautiful and good quality. They are very LOUD and take over the entire room. Great in a large room! The sun shining through them adds dimension like real scenery. Looks great Gorgeous curtains, nice thick material beautiful hanging on my window The quality was good but the curtain in the picture had completely different colors. Very light red and blue, not the rich vibrant colors advertised. Very disappointed. Very pretty curtains. Looks great with my decor. This photo was taken at night which is very cozy. During day the sun comes through so mandala doesn\\'t show up as much but still very pretty. Not sheer, not light blocking...a nice in between. One panel edge is sewn slightly crooked so just takes a little extra work to get it to look even but other than that I love them. We got these to hang in our comic and collectibles room and they really gave the entire atmosphere a fun upgrade. They would be great for a teens room or in our case an adults collectible room. The color is deep and solid and the quality is very durable. Need to steam them though to remove the creases from folding. Does not block out light though so make sure to line your windows with a blackout shade behind them to prevent UV bleaching of anything in the room. These curtains are the coolest for an Ancient Egypt history buff.  Was happy that Amazon suggested them. What a great idea and bargain considering how unique these curtains are.  I have two different designs. They look great, great quality fabric and are so unique ... love them!  The images connect across each panel and very nicely align. Looks great when fully expanded. Was very disappointed with the color which was very different from the picture.  The quality of the curtains were good but it would be nice if they sold curtains as they advertised.  Will be sending curtains back because they don\\'t match color I was hoping for.  Stop false advertising.  Show the true color of the curtains. I love these used as a room divider to hide my ugly kitchen cabinets. They were half the price of other designs for no discernable reason. I love these curtains.  I got them for my grandson\\'s superhero themed room.  He was super excited when I hung them up. Absolutely love these. The material keeps the room light but soft at the same time. Never received the second set that was ordered.  This set does me no good.  Never hot updates, and now cant send this one back.  Waste of $29. Put in grand daughters room, Paris theme. They are wonderful I read comments about the drapes, checked all the ratings, and was a bit hesitant to purchase.  Many ratings stated the curtains were made of cheap, thin material.  The ratings were all over the place.  When I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised. The curtains were exactly as pictured, AND were made of quality, thick material!  The rod pockets have enough room for just about any size rod ( measures 3 in).  I will venture to guess they use different materials for different prints or sizes.  The more complicated the print - the thinner material?  The curtains hang even , with no rolling or curling at the edges.  I am impressed, and will order a different print for my living room. Looked just like the picture.  They work great and look fantastic.  One tiny bit of caution, the lighter parts of the curtain (full moon) although beautiful seem not to block out the light much.  It does add a cool effect to the photo, but if you got the curtains for your bedroom, get used to waking up early because its a bit to bright for a light sleeper to sleep in. I made the mistake of buying 3 different pair of these and you have to really open them up and look close to figure out what the blurry, indistinct print is!! Bought these for my teenage son\\'s room.  Nice print that goes with his meditterean theme and blocks the sun. Was looking for an economical way to convert part of the unfinished basement into a nice sitting/recreation area. This was an easy way to hide a concrete block wall and breaker box. Very pleased with the outcome. It was supposed to block out the sun &amp; it  does not block out the sun at all. I love it PORTRAIT WAS JUST LIKE THE WEBSITE PICTURE, BEAUTIFUL!!! Excellent Love this design. It added so much character to our den. Not completely blackout but good enough. No complaints at all am very happy with the service you guy\\'s provide,keep up the awesome work!! Used for a cabin sliding glass door, added color to the room. Durable material and looks beautiful! we have had many compliments  on it! I loved the colors and feel of these curtains Really, truly EASY.  I stripped my walls down to PLASTER.  The bare wall space was from the edge of window into a corner and onto another wall to the other window, around a 1940 wall heater, and electrical outlet: so, you name it, this little project had it.<br><br>This product is DURABLE, THICK, and true QUALITY.  However, this is not like hanging wallpaper, and when I made the equal splice at the overlay, for whatever reason, it did NOT seam properly.  I love hanging wallpaper, and have much experience doing so, so I was able to correct the issue to the untrained eye (but I was still miffed about it, so I didn\\'t try THAT again (with wallpaper, you can nearly never find a seam of mine, so it bruised my ego, I suppose, more than anything)!  I messed up a tad on that, and the heater was in the area of a GORGEOUS CHARTREUSE coral :\\'(<br><br>One tip:  wallpaper is a repeated pattern, this is NOT (which is the BEAUTY of it).  So, if your purchased size is too large for the wall area; look at what you WANT to see, and what will need to be cut away, so you get to see/keep everything you most want in the end product!<br><br>Truly, it\\'s NOT as hard as you think!  Just have patience, don\\'t rush, and in the end I hope you\\'re as THRILLED as my 10yo is waking up and going to sleep feeling like he\\'s swimming/scuba diving in the ocean by a coral reef♡` I found a gem when I ran across this curtain.  This does not look like a Halloween prompt to me. This is very cute and just happen to represent the number of children my husband and I have.  I am using  it in my walk-in closet to cover my clothing solution.  It is very large and this room is 10x11 and it abut a foot short of going from wall to wall.<br><br>The material is much nicer and heavier than I thought it would be, so I am very pleased with this purchase and the value for which I got it;  I would definitely purchase another one. These curtains are really beautiful. Graphics are very realistic and the colors are so beautiful!<br>The material is very sturdy and has sort of a satin sheen to it and is so nice to work with, not so heavy so that you need a third bracket for the rod. When the sunlight shines in it back lights the scene on the curtains so that it looks like the moon is actually shining down on the water. I love these so much that I\\'m replacing all my plain curtains with ones like these in different scenes for each room! LOVE THEM! i have ordered other curtains from this company and they were beautiful, but this particular set was not like the picture, they were faded and one panel was longer than the other, i ordered them in aug but kept them in the package till nov. because i was waiting to paint the room, i wished i would\\'ve looked at them so i could have sent them back, i dont know if it was just this particular set, but i was so disappointed,  so make sure you check them well Heavy, high quality, beautiful. I had to send them back because the room started coming together towards a different overall design aesthetic, so they didn’t fit in anymore. Do I believe this curtain is worth $70? No<br><br>Does it look exactly like seller\\'s image? No, don\\'t believe any of them do. (It\\'s a lot more faded)<br><br>Am I happy with it? Meh<br><br>Am I satisfied with this product? Yea I guess it will do. I LOOOOOVE THESE CURTAINS! I have a tapestry to match too. The curtains are some what see threw but not to the point people can see in they just aren’t opaque. Really nice light fabric as well I love them. Looks exactly like the picture. I need to iron it out of it but it\\'s perfect. Very true to the picture online. Goes perfectly with my theme for the living room. Well made. Happy with purchase I bought the orange poppies. The curtains are of a good quality and exactly the correct length. But I’m very disappointed that they are much more faded orange than the picture indicates. I am putting them out on the patio where I formally had similar curtains. I needed something very deep colored and vibrant, and this doesn’t quite fit the bill... for the price, it’s even more upsetting. Just advertise truthfully, that would be nice. My sister love it Love it I was looking for a brighter color but it\\'s ok. my boys love it just the same Match bedspread perfect Beautifully as pictured and described. The graphics are not overly pixelated and the colors are nice. Would have given 5 stars if fabric was thicker, it’s the only downside I notice. The colors aren\\'t as vivid as the picture. The are actually kind of muted but otherwise the are cute. Not thick but seemingly sturdy. We\\'ll. see Got this to cover my closet. Nice pattern but the dimensions aren’t as described. Mine was 98x78 so it doesn’t cover as much of my closet as it should have. I wish I noticed the other review sizes before I bought this. I love these curtains. They look really great on my bedroom window. It goes good with the style of my room. Was exactly what I expected. Nice quality. Thanks After generations of girls, this transformed the room into a little boy\\'s room Very substantial rich fabric...the art work is clear...nice product The curtains were precisely as pictured and the art work is well done. Using them in the living room and they just pop the room - perfect colour match. I was really excited to get these curtains, now I can\\'t wait to get rid of them!  The colors in the pictures are bright and beautiful. In reality they are dull, dull DULL! Unrecognizable by comparison They are beautiful, received many compliments on them. Great curtains So much nicer than I expected for the price and love the pattern It makes you feel like you are sitting in a park.  Nice thick fabric. Esta un poco triste la imagen, hay mejores Love it got the matching throw pillows also I will be using this as a backdrop for my event.  Perfect. Great quality. Very nice curtains Super Cute Love it Absolutely beautiful curtains. Put them on my sliding glass doors to my balcony so when the light shines through they come alive. The fabric is very silky and easy to hang. Very pleased and would order again. They are really nice. They’re very pretty, and  I’m photophobic and enjoy how thick these curtains are, so they help block all light from coming in and let me be my vampire self. Very good curtains! Great for backdrops also, and very strong and durable. Beautiful curtains, great quality. My daughter LOVES them. Just like the picture! Very pretty and just what I wanted! Loved it. Transformed the entire entrance. My husband got it for one of our bathroom and he loved it Gorgeous match my livingroom These curtains are incredible. Not only are they beautiful but the material is really nice and heavy. Great GREAT quality. I can\\'t recommend them enough. I ended up not keeping the order because I noticed right away the curtains weren’t the bright version of the two. I didn’t even know there was a vintage version but I did notice the colors were more muted than the “floral” version of these curtains. Nonetheless I snapped a picture for reference and ordered the floral curtains. I debated returning them because they would be great in the fall and great for a boho look. Beautiful curtains! Great quality! Beautiful quality design gorgeous colors vibrant as they appear size as described the most beautiful thing about these curtains is when the light shines through it as if you were walking in the forest I bought these for my daughters first home And she says the compliments are daily these are great. i was concerned about image quality since they’re so large, but they look fantastic. they smelled pretty strong out of the package so i left them outside in the shade for a few days before bringing them inside. i’ll totally order more of these in the future. They look so distinct and realistic in the pictures.... they are not!!<br>They look NOTHING like in the pictures!! The print is blurry looking. So not worth the price paid. They are pretty big but when you put them up it kind of bunches up so it’s hard to tell that it’s doors but it still works and it’s great Wonderful colors Perfect for my aerial yoga room. Right length right width fits in Bay window. Let\\'s the light in and my neighbors can\\'t see through from outside. Looks awesome in my family room Look great. Hang nicely. These are dark so if your room is dark they may not stand out as much, but they\\'ll still good. Wonderful product - fabric is a nice weight and pattern is beautiful. Wow! I am no curtain expert. But these feel nice and silky, but not too thin. They feel a little heavier than I expected (which is good!). Will definitely still allow some light to come in, but that\\'s what I wanted! Colors are very vibrant.  I am moving in about a month so I don\\'t have photos of them after being washed and hung, sorry. They are beautiful they are made out of very nice material they’re thick can’t wait to hang them I was very pleased with the Curtains!! I love these curtains and think they work perfectly for my setting- a therapy room where I do play therapy with kids.  I gave this a low rating because of the lack of communication with the seller.  The product arrived 2 weeks after it was initially promised and the seller didn\\'t respond to either of the two emails I sent inquiring about my order.  Ultimately I\\'m happy with my purchase but wouldn\\'t order from them again due to the poor customer service. Love these ! They are unusual and a perfect addition to our room This is not the curtains I ordered. W. I noticed after the fact that when you pick out the curtains you want and go to select the size. It changes the curtain order to what is available in the size you need. These are a huge disappointment!! I have no choice but to keep them and be out of the money because my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I am the one daughter that does the actual physical care of her. The curtains I wanted were brown and actually look like barn doors. I won\\'t be ordering from Amazon for a lot of items. I noticed that some of the things you offer are cheeply made and I was kept in the prime program for months and not to my knowledge. That\\'s more money taken out of my account and I called twice before getting someone to get me out of it. I\\'m sorry and not satisfied  PERFECT!!! THESE CAME LOOKING JUST LIKE THE PICTURE AND WERE EVERYTHING I HOPED THEY WOULD BE!!! I could use a black out liner if I wanted to using the same rod or a double curtain rod but I\\'m not sure just yet.<br><br>PS. I thought this would keep the puppy out of the window but I was wrong again :) Looks amazing hanging up but totally worthless for sailing.  The material thickness and richness or vibrancy of the image must be seen in person if you’re interested in this. We are very happy with atmosphere the curtains add to our living room. I love these curtains, high quality, good texture these are just beautiful, I love them, well worth the money, they look beautiful in my living room. Beautiful!!!! Don’t hesitate to buy these curtains, high quality and well worth the price. I ordered these curtains because I loved the design &amp; colors. These arrived before they were due, were packaged well &amp; arrived in perfect condition.  The colors are beautiful! I was most impressed by the high quality of the fabric &amp; the quality workmanship. I ordered a shower curtain &amp; am very happy with it as well. I will order from this company again. I\\'m going to order another design &amp; hang them on a accent wall. So much you can do with these. I like the way it ads color and beauty to room. Very pleased with item and received it as expected. Omg I\\'m in love with this curtain. The quality and material is superb. They were not like the picture pretty but not what I thought they would be I returned them Very nice curtains, have got a lot of complements Utilicé  para ahorrarme la pintada de mi cuarto It resembles the Pic and I used it for a background drop! I loved it. great value I absolutely love these curtains. I have then hanging in my bedroom. They give me a sense of tranquility even at night or during storms. elegant and beautiful  this is a must have We have a globe room and these curtains really fit in perfectly! Super great price as well The Customers were excited to pose for a picture in front of the backdrop..I made enough to pay the backdrop off in 4 minutes. I pray they make a 10x10  or 10x20 Very sweet and vibrant. Great pattern.  Delivered fast. Beautiful, well made,  beautiful scenery!! match the spread i already purchsed The curtains look great but the print is lighter than what is pictured. It wasn\\'t bad enough for me to return them I just wish they had the darker contrast like in the photo, otherwise the print resolution is crisp. Love how these curtains bring the outdoors in. We have a large sliding door that the sun bakes us in the afternoon hours we can pull the curtains closed and not feel trapped in the living room. Fun 3D print. Graphics were not of fitting quality for curtain application. Return process was easy. Good value and added a needed pop of color to my kitchen This is one of two sets of Ambesonne\\'s Batik pattern Curtains. I\\'ve had them for over a year and they are still as lovely as the day I bought and hung them up. I did wash them in white vinegar before hanging to set the dye. (A trick my mother taught me decades ago.) After drying on air dry, I used a warm iron to remove any wrinkles.<br><br>You will love the colors of these curtains. My color scheme for my open floor home has the blue and oranges of both sets of curtains. This particular set is in my dining room while the other is in the living room. There was no funny smell and they arrived onetime undamaged from the seller.<br><br>I did not hang them on the rod, but used curtain clips which I find reduces the wrinkling of the curtain.  It also allows me to open and close them with little wear and tear.  All and all, I LOVE these curtain and LOVE AMBESSONE!! Love these curtains!!! I was disappointed in the quality of these. They were very lightweight and looked more like a shower curtain. I exchanged them for heavy cotton drapes. I bought these for my guest bathroom&gt; I wanted to add a funky touch and got these instead of a shower curtain (BORING!!!). They look great. They have a nice weight and are generously sized. They have a good sized space for a thicker rod which is a plus for me. I have received so many compliments on these drapes. My only regret is that I couldn\\'t get them in a longer size for my other windows in the opposite room. These are not washable, so don\\'t get them dirty unless you use a mild soap and water and hand dab. love these curtains. make it feel like the ocean these are to get. Put them in the massage room to hide Murphy bed. They worked great. Nice color, a bit thin. I LOVE these curtians. They hang beautifully and the light coming through them makes them look SO pretty. Love the print, also. N I love it! Looks great The picture doesn’t do justice to the vivid colors of these curtains. Added to my bay window that gets a lot of morning sunlight. They brighten the whole room. Pretty pattern but really cheap material. I pulled out one panel and my husband though it was a shower curtain  Good quality! My kids love them Excellent quality! This was a nice quality, but rather garish in person. Not good for my purposes. No problem returning it. Great design These curtains are NOT 84 inches long! I order 2 sets and all of them are BARELY 82 1/2 inches long! Heavy,silky,beautiful. We love it They are great quality and really awesome graphics Love it Looks absolutely nothing like picture The length is correct. I really loved it!! Love them but too long -I am returning them for the correct length. When I initially opened the package, I was disappointed...the curtains are very thin.<br>However...once I hung them up, they look even better that on the posted images.....they do not block out light, but rather have a beautiful golden glow when lights are on behind it....perfect for me!<br>They arrived all folded up and I thought I would have to Steam-iron them...but within 48 hours of hanging them up, they appear perfectly straight now.... LOVE that!  5 Stars all the way from me! Pretty curtains and very thick material. Was expecting more floral than white. It’s a little too little girls room for my taste but that doesn’t take away from them being great quality. We got these curtains for our daughters nursery and I love them. They make a big impact and the colors are bright, the images are crisp and the quality is great. Nice thick fabric. We did put blackout curtains behind because these are light filtering and definitely not blackout. These curtains are the coolest for an Ancient Egypt history buff.  Was happy that Amazon suggested them. I have two different designs. They look great, great quality, are so unique ... love them! These are so pretty to me. They are very bright and colorful. They do not block out light though. We like them very much. Had to buy matching drapes for each side I love these curtains. I do wish I had known they were going to be shiny, but I’m over it and love them. they look awesome for a music room. Horrible purchase!!! Cheaply made, falling apart and smells terrible!! I was really concerned about buying this but it turned out great. These were exactly what I wanted.  The detail is fantastic and exceeded my expectations.  You have to iron out the fold marks from shipping but the material irons out easily.  I\\'m very happy with my purchase. Lighter colors to brighten a room. Fit patio doors perfectly Thick oh my I absolutely love this curtain nicely done Beautiful!! I would love to know who measured these curtains. May I please have the address to mail them a tape measure? Quality nice, fabric beautiful, but not even close to length. Excelente inversion. Era lo q estaba buscando para dividir cuarto de dormitorio de la sala. M fascino Love these curtains very nice looking and quality Love my new curtains, are not see through. Beautiful,  curtains. I love them so much. Love it Beautiful, high quality item.  Using to decorate church for harvest festival.  Will update with photos after Thanksgiving :) The item was too big for the intended windows and had to be returned, but the quality of the curtains was pretty solid. These are beautiful. Brighten up my living room.  Very good quality., I recommend it. Great looking, blocks the right amount of sun and they are a wonderful conversational piece. Están hermosas aunque muy sencillas para el precio We have hardwood floors with black and red area rugs .  So difficult to find curtains to match with it being some solid color or outlandish pattern.  These curtains are just striking !  We have a lodge /rustic theme with shiplap /repurposed wood with Amish furniture .  You have striking shades of true reds- no pinks, no oranges.  Then you have blacks and a soft white background .  It so looks like a misty Fall morning as we live where we have fog in the  mornings.  We own many different pairs of Ambesonne curtains and Amazon is where I come for my curtains when I redecorate.  Ambesonne has beautiful rich colors, holiday and seasonal themes , as well as whatever color palate suits your needs.  We are elated and have already ordered from Amazon a pair of Ambesonne Winter theme curtains that will replace these after the holidays as  yes, we also own Christmas curtains from Ambesonne , also purchased from Amazon.  The quality is there, they are not some thin, see thru cheap looking curtains.  We own a dozen pairs or more so that should tell you our level of satisfaction with this brand.  Thank you Amazon !  Well done ! These curtains look great. They aren\\'t very room darkening, in that I chose a light colored design and therefore light does still come through, but they are very cool looking up on the windows. Picture of the ocean looks great, though not as digitally clear as the picture on the website suggests. This picture window cover turned into the perfect addition to a wall in my room.  It adds depth and dimension to an otherwise small rom.  The fabric is wrinkle resistant and hangs well. I love the fact that it hides the storage shelves behind it. i ORDERED THESE TO GO INTO MY RED/WHITE SEWING ROOM. I NEEDED TO MATCH THE PAINT TO THESE CURTAINS BUT THEY ARE ORANGES AND PINKS NOT RED. VERY DISAPPOINTED Didn’t looked like the description and was not happy with the look or the money cost ; not my design looking for They are typical but just not as well made as I had hoped. They will work for what I need. cheap..stupid..don\\'t bother Great view to wake up to in the morning Print blurry looking. Nothing like advertised. Love it looks grate in my room Lovely print. Not much storage in my apartment. Covered shelving in my living room with them. Enough width to wrap around both. I absolutely LOVE my new curtains. Beautiful, great quality! Love these curtains Awesome Just received them today and hung them up. Love them I am very pleased with my purchase. Exactly what i wanted, good heavy fabric. Ironed easy and looks perfect. Beautiful! I put it up in an office without windows to add scenery. People come from around the building to see it because someone told them about it. Love this curtain! Its easy.. the material is great Sooo Beautiful in person.. bought these to use as \"door\" from my kitchen to my dining room. they are beautiful and quality is excellent. would def recommend These curtains feel like shower curtain and are very short. They look a lot better in pics. I’m sending them back. Looks realistic Just note that these are not blackout curtains. The artwork is great. I was looking for a backdrop for my Halloween party and couldn\\'t find anything big enough.  Then I came across these curtains.  They\\'re the perfect size! great colors, great quality!! Great quality for the price.  I used these in a room for a Halloween Party. Didn\\'t block any sunlight at all They look \"fine\" but they aren\\'t exactly the image posted. I bought the vintage firework sale one. The bright red shown on the image on line is pretty misleading. In reality the red is closer to a pinkish color. Colors are more muted and not as vibrant as shown.<br><br>I purchased a shower curtain at the same time and have the same complaints with those colors. Be aware. The bright, vibrant colors shown on line are not reflective of the actual colors. Wait to buy anything \"matching\" until you can see them in person. The bright red curtains I bought to coordinate on the other window do not match at all. I love the design of this curtain. it transformed my room from boring to spectacular! These curtains are great! I am in awe of the beauty they have brought to complete room !! They are nice soft and amazing in color!! Looks great exactly as described. This gave my living with red walls  a new look. The traditional curtains was nice but this curtains are different and beautiful. Very colorful. I liked the curtain and the tie backs, will be sued for a picture window. There perfect. I have them in my living room,keeps ac in and summer heat out... And great privacy... I use it for my bedroom it’s very beautiful Ok It turned out cool, I like it! Very pretty but needs to be just a bit more color to it! I would purchase again As I was afraid of, we had to return this, because by going with shorter curtains all it did was squash the image from top to bottom ... there is unfortunately no cropping of the image to retain the best portion of it, but instead simply smash it to fit whatever dimensions. So elegant! Vibrant colors. Beautiful colors but they don\\'t match when hung It was not a good quality. I wanted it to be nice material for decoration for my leaving room and it looked as if it was plastic curtains for my shower room . I totally disliked it and returned it in The curtain makes the environment a friendly one.  It soothes your body mind and soul.  It gives you that inward peace and happiness . For the value 100% for the practicality not so much but that was my choice. These curtains look great and add a nice botanical tropical back ground vibe. Worked grest for our Tiki vivarium reptile room and feel happier for the reptiles to have a faux jungle background. These curtains could be used w/o windows just for fun background. Not at all what I expected Nice quality, great printing, looks great in my daughters bedroom! She really wanted grommets on her curtains, which we purchased elsewhere and added to these curtains. Material didn’t fray at all. Holding up to daily used perfectly Very pretty and sturdy. Good for black out with some light Not at all what I expected Way too big for a regular window. 1 panel works for a regular window. 2 panels are for a bay window. you need both panels to get a full picture. An image of the pig and the train is split between two panels. My windows looked  amazing. I am very satisfied with the material and the way they looked. We have a cabin with a western theme. These curtains were perfect to cover a set of French doors. They reminded us of an old western town that we visited in Cody. These look like they were designed for a baby nursery and the fabric is very cheap looking.  I returned them and found MexicaliBlues curtains instead.  So happy now. Arrived quickly. Looks great. Lets light in but is not see through. Nice curtain but too pricey. Love these. Very nice quality When I purchased tos curtains I just wanted to see what will them do to my studio in NYC...it is the first time I put effort to make my space somewhat my own style and a place that could remind me of  a k home in Puerto Rico...I was blown away with how good they look ,...wild it look the same at a different spot?..who knows but I think they are amazing,,,,am now waiting in another 2 orders cause I find myself having fun switching the curtains and the “theme”in my space ....am<br>Sure you will like them 2!!!! I love the pattern on these curtains but the material was a little cheaper than I wanted for 40$ curtains. It is sort of shiny and thick like a shower curtain, and the flower images were stretched out of their proportion. I loved them but am super bummed they didn’t quite work for my living room. Loved it Absolutely beautiful and changes the persona of the room to one with a positive vibe These curtains are incredible! They open up the feel of my room significantly compared to regular curtains.  Then graphics are excellent and the thickness is perfect added protection from cold drafts..  I love them and highly recommend. The tropical scene is just beautiful and the curtains are of excellent quality.<br>We have two large double size windows in the bedroom- and when closing the curtains it\\'s gives you the impression you\\'re on the islands.  Nice scene to wake up to. The6 arrived earlier than anticipated. More beautiful in person. Those who complain they are wrinkled, that is why irons were invented. The only thing is I wish they had a tab back option. They do not move freely on the curtain rod so, I am adding tabs to the back to make them easier to open and close. Other than that, they were well worth getting and I be ordering from this company again. These look very cool. I would recommend getting a larger-than average rod and curtain rings because they look best when hung straight.<br>If you\\'re hoping to block sunlight, these aren\\'t going to fit the bill. I have these hung on a double curtain rod with white curtains behind them and together they block some light, but a lot still comes through. The white curtains are heavy room-darkening curtains too. So if you want something room darkening, these aren\\'t going to work.<br>As for durability, I am afraid to wash them because of the many colors and the way it\\'s printed, which is not good because mine are hung in a kids room and are going to need to be washed at some point. Buy these if they\\'re going to be in a safe place where they won\\'t need to be washed. Heavy, thick curtains that really made our sons theme of his room come together. It is very eye catching and just pops at you! Great quality that almost black out the room too. Love, love, love! I like that it’s just what I ordered and the time limit was great. This product is set in my living room window. Thank you These curtains are gorgeous in the day when the sun causes a back light effect. At night, I shine a lamp on them so people on the street can enjoy them as well. They replaced standard white curtains, which I never looked at, but now, each morning I get to enjoy a sunrise and a sunset in the evening. It\\'s better than looking at my neighbor\\'s house, anyway. These curtains are beautiful but they were too long for my windows. This was used for a Christmas party at the beach scene and everyone loved it! Bang on.  Thicker then I anticipated and quality of image is very good. Great quality with a wonderful design. We will enjoy these curtains. My mother wanted something different for her French doors,  she loves these curtains. Perfect print quality and heavyweight material. I bought it to cover my dinning room window as a backdrop to my Asian themed dinner party.  It was a hit! It pulled everything together. Now I’m looking for a Hollywood sign for a black and white Movie night themed dinner party. Love the look. It’s a bit large for small windows. But manageable We have sliding glass door in our dining room and this looks fantastic. Loved the curtian, it is even better than expected Their is nothing to complain about.  I love these curtains.  They look exactly like the picture. The material was cheap. First bought the fall forest curtain, Now this winter scene both for the patio door and love them . Light comes thru during the day (though you can\\'t see through) and at night they are beautiful also. I sew some so i think I will be sewing them together  rather than have two pieces to draw closed  as needed. Ambersonne does the print really well (just as pictured) and I\\'m getting lots of compliments &amp; questions (where did you ever find them - Amazon of course) they\\'re a perfect weight and hang well. Very impressed.. look good I received these today.. The only thing I might fault them on is that I would have liked to have matching tie backs..They don\\'t send any.. of course they did not promise any either..any way It would have been nice to have a way to tie back. Other than that.. I  love it.they look very nice in my utility room.. And they allow enough light  pas thrugh so that the room  keeps it\\'s light and airy feel.. Over all  I am happy with them. Love, Love, Love how this looks in our living room!  It goes with our theme colors and turns the room into a magical nature-scape, while still looking classy. I love these curtains. Super cute and add color to my dining room. these curtains are very nice...they are picture prefect.  Everybody who sees them loves them... This does allow light to come in, so not room darkening. The back is white. The print does line up pretty darn close (Only a little bit on the top was not quite evenly matched between the two panels.) The photo attached was taken during daylight hours, so you could see the transparency. I purposely lined the panels up so the darker \\'ground\\' was lower than the window frame, this doesn\\'t get the sunlight shining through it.  Yes, you do see the seams, which will break up the pattern in the muddle, but that is to be expected. Normally you\\'d want curtains at least a third wider than the window, but because of the print, you\\'ll want to get as close to actual window length as you can, so there isn\\'t as many pleats/folds. The colors of this one go perfectly with the colors of my room. I\\'ve only had these up for a short time, so I can\\'t comment on the longevity of them. So far I love them! Used them for a faux-wall look inside a horse trailer dressing room. My friends are amazed! If I had used real wood, I would have added hundreds of pounds to my towing weight. I love these, they look great in my kitchen, as I wanted to give it a rustic kind of feel, since the kitchen is a nice size, I wanted a restaurant kind of feel. I am still working on the kitchen, otherwise I would upload photos for you. Maybe later in the year, I will post I really do love this , would have given it 5 stars but, it’s lighter than shown in picture. Would have liked it more vibrant and darker , also would have liked  a solid color on other side besides white.  Nice material and love the picture. curtains look great.....made out of really great material Good quality just don’t look like the pick it’s more of a faded wood, but it’s nice and big Put fairy lights behind it on a window.  Very pleasing to look at. Cheery curtains.  Lets a lot of light through. Perfect summer curtain. As pictured, good quality and arrived sooner than expected! I thought it was a wall cover but it is actually exactly like a shower curtain. Makes my LR pop and everyone loves it Beautiful Good I love these curtains! Excellent curtain..not completly dark but looks gud High quality curtains Great quality. Material is very durable. Design is as pictured. Loved the material and curtain was so differnr These were for a friend and she absolutely loves them! I was expecting a color as vibriant as shown in picture. This product looks nothing like the description.  Very diasppointed in the product returning immediately!!! Love the design It wasn\\'t my expected quality Very good Would be better if grommets were added to allow ease in opening or closing drapes.<br><br>Appreciated the length, fits my window height. Also allows for height adjustments Very cute but they got wet and the color ran. The window was left open during a storm and now some of the cats are blue and splotchy. I am so in love with these:) I absolutely love these! I will be buying more!!! Art lines up from panel to panel.  They are beautiful, and well made.  Looks like a mural.  I already have another set on the way with different art.  Great job!!!! I\\'m very happy I bought these curtains. It\\'s like having a huge picture on my wall. I hung them in the livingroom. They look good in the morning and at night time. I would definitely buy this again. The colors are not as dark or vivid as pictured. The back side is white so it appears white on the outside, I dont like that. Overall the print is pretty just not as attractive as shown. This fits so good and my son room. It does block the Sun and I love the design, turned out great nan This item is great  Perfect. Great material. I wasn’t expecting to be so beautiful. The curtains are more like orange than \"real\" (red) buffalo plaid. Color clashes with everything else in the room, so we cannot use them. I missed the return date, so that\\'s money down the drain. If you buy them, just consider the other colors they need to coordinate with. Great qulity All i can say is they look great . Big Steam Punk fan. Awesome quality. Good I’ll be the first to admit it...I thought these curtains would be super thin, cheapy...not even worth the inexpensive price I paid for them! I mean, HOW could they be anything but when I paid such a low price?!? Well...call me dumbstruck! I cannot BELIEVE how gorgeous these...absolutely stunning curtains turned out to be!<br>Since they aren’t really thick, they drape down beautifully (but they’re by no means flimsy or sheer). Design wise, the details are spectacular...I now have a castle balcony out my condo’s sliding glass door!<br>Now, it’s just a matter of choosing the next “scene” I want to look out my window &amp; see! The prices of these curtains can vary widely. In my case, they were $19.99. So, I found them to be very reasonable and good for that price. I have seen other curtains cost three times that amount from the same company, so if I had paid that much, I\\'m not sure I would be as happy. They were slightly shorter than indicated.  The image is not quite as bright as the photo.  In terms of novelty, I find them quite nice.  I just hung them up, so I cannot speak to their quality as far as washing them goes. Curtains look beautiful on Amazon....at home... not quite the same.  Even the floral pattern is different.<br> &amp; just like another review, it looks like an old print, like when you run out of ink on your printer &gt;.&lt;<br><br>These are going back! &amp; Pronto! This added such a beautiful backdrop to my Christmas tree and taking holiday pictures !  I received so many compliments for this seasonal window treatment. Great purchase! So beautiful, love them Love it These curtains are amazing when back lit by the Sun! We live in a wooded setting, so these curtains are perfect for our guest room.  The colors are just as pictured and the size is just as we ordered. Beautiful effect , light filters through softly and enhances the entire picture Love it nan This is just a great set of curtains, hands down.... They are awesome, lighted up my room. Bought the second one they suggested  it compliments the first one.<br>I feel like I\\'m on the beach. Like everything including the fact that they let in light. These curtains are amazing.  The color is perfect for everything in the room.  It looks like you are looking out a window at a beautiful tree.  The panels match up exactly.  They also are white on the back which is nice for the outside, especially since the apartment complex requires that.  They do block out most light.  I actually turned on a light in the room, first an overhead ceiling light, and then two lamps by a bed.  Since this room faces the street, I then walked outside to see if you could see into the room and you cannot, not even a silhouette!  To be certain, I even set up a scarecrow I had, standing near the window, and from the outside you wouldn\\'t even know it was there. The colors are light, so makes the room seem light and airy while giving a much better view to look at and makes a nice comfy, warm feeling in a guest room.  They are good quality, and were also easy to hang. Absolutely, exactly what I was looking for.  I was so impressed with the look that I actually decided to order similar \"photo curtains\" for my living room and dining room. I would not hesitate to suggest these... oh, and the colors are exactly as they are in the photo! These were for my living room and dinning area that face each other...Totally perfect reflection of the two areas...Everybody loves them...Thank you Very thick curtains; good for keeping light from coming in from outside. To thick of material IT LOOKS CHEAP Very nice quality. Beautiful scene. Para la ventana del cuarto de mi bebé. Nice and thick great kid curtains Love these! They are heavier than I realized. Great design and easy to hang. Curtains are good quality and gorgeous print. A little pricey. Love these curtains. Love the fabric Good quality Love them Using 2 different mountain/lake scenes for Living Room. Amazing effect. Beautiful and it\\'s very pleasant to look at in the living room. The family loves this it’s so beautiful when the sun shines  through it These curtains are just beautiful!  The colors are vibrant.  Makes me feel as though I am in that log cabin. I am glad I purchased these. Great price and looks super cute against my Hunter green walls. Plus, plaid is rad. Decent quality, but you will need to line these if you expect them to block out ANY light. The fabric is kind of a satin and doesn\\'t lay especially well, but it works for our purposes. Love them turned a drab room into my sanctuary. This scene is lovely!<br>We have a long closet in our room.  These drapes will hang from ceiling to floor and will be a wonderful visual feast every morning.  These drapes are lined and of sufficient weight for their purpose.<br>The colors in the drapes are not quite as vivid as pictured....but it does come very close.<br>All in all.... weight, lining, scene detailing...  5 stars is acceptable! This set is beautiful to look at. I can sit in my sunroom and have tea or a drink as just look at the view for hours it brings just the right touch of color to the room. made well and sturdy My daughter visited and she thought it was a real door. if you iron it, or steam it, you can fool quite a few people. of course from up close you can tell it\\'s cloth, but from a bit of distance and in pictures, it\\'s a nice extra umph to your ambience. I put these curtains up as a privacy screen for a loft bedroom when we have guests.  Our 1st guests came, and told me repeatedly how much they love these curtains, despite her brother having renovated the entire house.  The curtains were her favorite.  She also thought that he had made doors to close off the room when she was looking at them from the downstairs.  I love them &amp; they are definitely a talking point. I just love these curtains!  We live in upstate New York and I NEED all the sand and sun and palm trees I can get!  When I look at these curtains, it lifts my spirits and makes the winter more bearable! Looking for a decent view on a plain wall, this accent works perfectly to bring some life to a room Stunning I just love the scene it looks great in my living room, will be ordering another one Very Dissatisfied has has a very bad stain. Don’t understand. Pay too much money for this! Was hesitant to order given no previous ratings, but was pleasantly surprised.  They are a decent weight/thickness which was my main concern; didn\\'t want thin/see-through curtains given they are for the bedroom.  The color saturation is great too--true to the picture advertised.  I ordered a matching 16\" pillow and duvet from the same company also and both are good quality, though the duvet image is a little lighter than the curtains. Overall great except a bit overpriced (hence 4 vs 5 star rating). Heavy weight fabric. I ordered the floral with white background and they are not see through. They have a lot of body to them and seem to be a light weight polyester Just like lotus love them they look just like the picture. initially i was a little underwhelmed.  Honestly these photograph a little more dynamic than they appear in person because the light coming through on photo makes them appear more like a sunset.<br><br>visually looking st them they appear more opaque which is good and bad, gives adequate privacy but doesnt look like the photo<br><br>overall i think they are a reasonably priced unique solution for window or doors in my case.  The material is quality weight. I was hesitant to purchase these bc the pictures looked like they may have been doctored. The material is shiny and cheap looking. Not the way it looked in the product picture. Looks like cheap costume material as opposed to what curtains should be made from. Save your money. I put up a mural on one wall in our theater room and these curtains matched perfectly, I was very happy to see that they were lined and a nice weight, they really complimented the room. Soooo Pretty! This is exactly what I was hoping for. We\\'re doing an Avengers room so realistic space curtains were a must.<br>They\\'re a great weight and although not blackout, depending on how large your window is they will definitely minimize the light coming through! Good quality. I smile everytime I look at them. Curtains are solid white on the outside and a beautiful ocean scene. When the sun is hitting the outside of the curtain, the sky in the image almost looks real. The curtain is great. It has a nice scene that feels like waking up on a tropical island. They are thick enough to keep out the light but thin enough to show the scene with the sun shining. Perfect exactly what I wanted Pretty cheap quality but does the job. Not blackout curtains and in the sun the pattern appears almost see through.  The leopard pattern is also really large compared to regular proportionate size leopard spots. Can\\'t wait to get my leopard bedding. These curtains are soft and silky. A nice change of pace from traditional curtains, its not a blackout curtain if thats what your after but its well built and aesthetically pleasing. Ambesonne is the only company i will order curtains from! They are worth every penny! Beautiful curtains. Thicker material than I thought itd be. Generally great quality curtains. Some rough stitching on the top of one set where the seamstress made several lines of stitches in different angles, but can\\'t be seen once hung. Decent quality, love the design. Surface is almost a sheen, plastic finish (like a soft shower curtain) due to the print and light coating that must be over it. Thick, silky and absolutely beautiful. nan Beautiful curtains good quality and in the washer comes out looking new . Will buy again Beautiful colors and decent material The sellers were amazing! Loved the product too Love everything about it!! Print was cute but I didn\\'t like the fabric.  I returned them This was an awesome addition to our backdrop to our Ladies Retreat. I will use these types of curtains again for backdrops. They are not as expensive to buy like a real backdrop. They are beautiful as well and durable. I like the smooth texture and drape of the fabric. The design is clear and well printed. These would have been perfect except for the color. Instead of a standard brown, the design is more of a golden olive that clashed with my wall color. I am retuning this set, but I would order from the vendor again based on the quality of the product. I ordered the mountain curtains for my son\\'s room and they are great. The image is clear, the grays are really cool and the curtains feel thick and of good quality. I put blackout shades behind to block the light. Simply beautiful and perfect for my 3 daughters. Beautiful print It was nicer in person. I LOVE IT! The colors were nice &amp; bright &amp; the fabric is nice &amp; thick. I Just ordered another one with a different print. Theyre more orange than red. Idk if this is just this one set or all, but its definitely orange on a lot of it. Ill contact the seller and update if its resolved, but I\\'d recommend going with a different set for others Love them I thought these would be PERFECT!  Unfortunately, the picture of the curtains doesn\\'t make clear how large the actual print is.  It looks almost cartoonish instead of folk-arty.  Also, colors are less bright.  Disappointed.  Quality of construction seemed fine. Very well made Don’t waist your money!!! These curtains aren’t worth half of what they are selling for. Never again will I buy curtains on line. The print is light and washed out. Nothing like the picture. It blocks very little light. Pretty disappointed, especially considering the price. It did fit the space but just looked cheap. Absolutely adorable.  Not a single complaint.  The lighting in my room isn’t that great.  The colors are so much better in person!! Perfect pastel palette Not good I ordered this thinking I was getting a full tree, but instead the two panels are half a tree.... It didn\\'t say I needed to order 4 panels??? These are are SO nice! Not thin junk like other sellers. These are gorgeous. Obviously used them for Halloween. They worked perfectly as a room divider/backdrop for pictures.<br>Recommended! Lovely fabric and vivid color. Super fast delivery I bought 2 sets of different wood scene curtains for my bedroom.  I picked two sets that looked as similar as possible.  And I LOVE them.  At first, I admit, I wasn’t sure.  They are a very different look and the fabric is sort of… shiny and thin…  So, for the first day or so I wasn’t sure.  But everyday I love them more.  I think it was just such a different look.  I am delighted with my purchase and love waking up in the woods. Love these curtains. My living room looks like a quite place of privacy and relaxation. good weight and fabric is a firm texture. I recommend this product Pretty disappointed in these.  Not satin as described,  more of a cheap fabric shower curtain feel and crinkly sounding. Expensive for the what you get. Cheap cheesy. I Ordered the boho medallion one. We purchased this for the living room to cut down on the light from outside and still make it seem like your looking outside and that is just what it did. It is the most restfull scene that brings peace of mind when indoors. Am looking forward to other landscapes to enhance my view in the future. Scenery printed onto curtains is a super idea! So many scenery/themes to choose from too! Nice quality fabric, also. We are traveling in a motorhome. I bought this curtain to seperate the front cab (driving space) from the living space. Not only did it create a peaceful atmosphere, the space appeared larger due to the depth of perception of the path. I love it!!! Very soft and thick at the same time, great photo quality, could double as a shower curtains Room went from eh to OOOOOh real fast Was worried about being to much purple but looks even better in person Beautiful They are just beautiful, I just bought the wrong size so I had to return them. Really high end quality. Definitely a great buy So cute in my dog room on patio door and washable Love it I’ Buy more designs<br>Perfect in everything<br>Looks like real I think these were even better in person- definitely worth it! The fabric is thick and the colors are great! Beautiful This curtain is beautiful and the colors are brilliant!! Bought for church nursery - perfect and so colorful. Colors and pattern was absolutely perfect. The sliding doors of my large closet were old and hard to slide, so I replaced them with the Forest Pathway design, and the curtain fit perfectly. Now I wake up with a view of a lovely forest –&nbsp;much better and prettier than the old rickety sliding doors! Not worth the money. Ok Brightens the room up nicely. Much better than expected!! Recommend!! I paid way too much for what was obviously a print on cheap fabric. It\\'s not so cheap that I\\'m unhappy with the product but the price was not justified by the quality. The product matched the description perfectly.  The woodland creatures fit perfectly in the babies woodland themed room.  We have blinds behind the curtains creating the perfect amount of light shining entering through the window. I bought for my living room looks beautiful not as bright as the picture shows which is great it\\'s just enough color without looking overwhelming I love them I bought 3 other curtains (different scenes) from this company and this one was not as vibrant as the picture displayed. The colors from the moon blend with the background and it looks more grey. There arent any clouds, only grey areas in my curtains. The color, weight and feel are terrific, however I received to left curtains. bummer. This curtain set was just as advertised. It arrived on time and I had no issues with packaging. It is a perfect accent to my boy\\'s super hero themed bedroom. I used this curtain set in a corner as a super hero changing station. Would definitely recommend! Looks great in my boys room.<br>Material is heavy and think, feel very durable. I love it. Great buy for the money!! Beautiful. They were better than expected Liked Didn\\'t appear the same. These look less shiny and different from picture in person. Heavier material than expected. I really wanted to like these curtains!  The picture online looked so great and my son loved it. When it arrived however, the picture was so blurry that the dragon and knight aren’t even really discernible. Had I not already known what the picture was supposed to be, I would have had trouble telling what was on it. The material isn’t great either. Very happy with this purchase. The quality was a bit better than I expected for the price. They look great in my son’s room. He loves how they “glow” as the milky way allows more light but the navy blocks more. Look amazing! The detail is really great and the cloth is heavy enough to drape right but light enough to tie up if I want natural light These curtains exceeded my expectations for the price.  They are made from a high quality material (not sheer, not too thin), and the design is quality as well.  They are too heavy for what I need, but they would be wonderful under normal circumstances. This is a good product, I also bought the same brand for my kitchen with a Hawaiian waterfall scene. This is well made and has good material. I am pleased with the purchase. I did wish the colors were more definitive. My son has them in his<br>room and loves them. Excellent! No complaints at all. Exactly as pictured Not what I expected. I really like these curtains. They are beautiful. Measurements were were wrong  the height and width were backwards Doesn look good These curtains are amazing!<br><br>The kids love them, and they look even better in person than they did in the product image.<br><br>When sunlight hits them it really makes the spiral galaxy image pop out and glow a bit.<br><br>We\\'re very happy with this purchase, and I plan on buying a different version of these in the future from this company.<br><br>* (If you found this review to be informative and/or helpful, please click \"Helpful\" to let me know. Thanks! ) * I gave this 4 stars because it\\'s as described.  I returned it because the color was darker than I expected when it arrived and doesn\\'t fit my décor.  That may be due to how my computer screen displays it.  For the price, it seems like it would be very durable and study. Exactly as expected These were better than we thought they would be. A great value Cheap and thin Not what I want it Simply beautiful &amp; fun ! Horribly disappointed. The curtain panels did not match at all. The look like the were from 2 completely different fabric parts. I was do excited to get these only to not be able to use them. Beautiful! We love it. Look realistic Looks Beautiful  in my room. Love it Nice scenery No hanging hardware included.  It’s HUGE - so, plan to put it in a large space Beautiful picture, good material. Absolutely beautiful! Nice fabric and light filtration. Me encantó lo puse en la sala con una hamaca y se ve genial, me relaja en los días pesados, me hace sentir relajada Everyone that sees this likes it.  Very calming and makes you want to walk right down the path. I love these curtains  it feels like your there Dark, drab, and blurry picture. For the price I was expecting much better. I wanted several designs from this company but now I\\'m wary. And they\\'re already hanging because my wonderful fiancee decided to surprise me and get them up before I got up. Beware and check the curtains design before you hang them. The material is a decent thickness polyester so it has a little shine to it. I may see if I can return them even though they\\'ve been hung. They are just like in the picture. Beautiful long curtains that make your window, a window into the woods. These are lovely curtains. When I look at them on a snowy day, I don\\'t feel as cold and lonely. Wow! These were more than I expected.  I don\\'t have to look out my window anymore at the dull drabness of the Winter.  These are so very pretty. I have received rave reviews about these curtains.  Everyone loves them almost as much as me.  I have a jungle room and these curtains amaze everyone. The tigers look like they could jump off the canvas they are so realistic. When I first opened them, I noticed that the colors were not as bright or clear as in the picture.  The color is more a wine  color and while the ornaments are clear, the rest is blurry. .what is supposed to be fir and snowflakes reminds me of streamers instead.  I  was a bit disappointed, but I have still received a lot of good comments about them. They will only be up for a few weeks a year, so I will keep them. These curtains are well-made. They\\'re heavy so they insulate, too. Great decor and practical. Absolutely Beautiful. Item is as vibrant as the picture. Colors are as in picture. Shipping was fast and item was packaged great too. I love it! First of all, I just want to say that the material of the curtains was absolutely beautiful. The designs were clear and not blurry. They were shiny on the front and  the backs were white. I was disappointed when I saw that instead of a rich forest green, most of the greens were a light lime green color. There was nothing in my living room that would go with those colors. I would have kept them, but the colors just didn\\'t work out. Pattern not as pictured Nice curtain but material is too cheap. Makes the while room feel light.. Love it TODO ME AGRADO ESTÁN BELLÍSIMAS<br>ÚNICAMENTE QUE AL PEDIRLAS NO MEDÍ MI VENTANA Y QUEDARON ARRASTRÁNDOSE LAS REGRESARÉ Y PEDIRÉ OTRAS MÁS CORTAS.. Dearly love! Great size.. Nice heavy fabric looks amazing.. Bedroom windows. So glad I found these while looking through Christmas decorations! They are absolutely beautiful and great quality! Looks exactly like the picture I love it I love this pattern. Perfect for any plant lover I like that the material is wrinkle free and the print is bright and beautiful, Christmasy!<br>I couldn\\'t stand the toxic smell at the beginning so I had to open and let sit outside for a couple of days to air it out and get rid of the toxic smell. Now it\\'s ok.<br>Over all I recommend it Bought this for my daughter who’s favorite color is purple. She loved it! Beautiful color But when installed looks kind of cheap I love them just wish I got it in a shorter size 90\" was too long for my sliding door but i made it work Product is beautiful. Will post picture when I put up. I wanted to get a door to cover the laundry area at the top of the stairs, but I didn\\'t want the door to take up a bunch of space, etc.  Also, I wanted the cat to have easy access to the litter box.  So I found this curtain and it\\'s perfect!  I like the way it looks and it\\'s easy to pull to the side to load the washer, etc.  If this review was helpful to you, please vote \"yes\". The curtains are nice but the image definitely isn’t as vivid as it is on the photo. I was disappointed with the washed out look so I added grommets to give them a little more spunk. Not worth the money. They are ugly These curtains are beautiful. I love the images. Looks great I love the way this looks! And thick material blocks some of the cold from the door itself I was more than a little surprised at the great quality of these curtains. I couldn\\'t be happier, they absolutely have the look I was going for. Love them looks great! This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she is extremely pleased! Looks great but it is not wide enough for my window and I can\\'t find extension panel to cover the whole window They are of great quality and if you love Christmas and live going all out in decor for the holiday, I highly recommend them. Beautiful just as I wanted in my guess room These were nice but not as bold as I would have liked. Nice material but picture could be sharper and darker Just getting my living room ready for New Year. I really like it.  I just bought two red window panels and it makes it look great. The material quality was ok. The curtains were expensive and I didn’t get what I expected. The image that is on the website that not what I got. The image on the website had an Eiffel Tower on each curtains but the curtains I received had half Eiffel Tower on one and half of the Eiffel Tower on the other.  I have been looking at these curtains from Christmas 2018.  These were the only curtains I purchased this year. It\\'s like art work hanging in my bedroom windows One might think they are walking into a brick wall it had a shine didn\\'t look good Looks great These are absolutely beautiful curtains! They look just as pictured and the colors are nice and vibrant. I\\'ve had nothing but compliments on them. Love these curtains. They look very nice when you close them at night and I keep a little light behind it on the windowsill that shines through. I got this one and then I bought one that was a lighter color instead of the darker shade in the background and they both look great Quedo hello en mi ventana me gusts la naturaleza y El Arte y combinar para mi es un hermoso tapete y me encanto I want my money back. Very poor quality for price. Great product The drapes are lovely.  My guest room is decorated with wildlife photos and antiques.  These drapes give just the finishing touch I was looking for.  Living in a rural town in Idaho hunting and fishing are big pastimes and they go with the lifestyle perfectly.  My little dog loved the fabric as well, she never gets on things and won\\'t get off  when told but she loved laying on the curtains.  Made it a little difficult to get them arranged so we could hang them properly.  We are both very happy with the purchase and will tell others about Ambesonne. My husband picked these out but everyone loves them Absolutely awesome curtains! Great material, you wont be disappointed. True to color I love my curtains. Not as vibrant as I thought it would be. Beau tissus, dessins d’arbres réalistes, nous sommes très satisfaits.<br>On recommande sans hésiter. I was not impressed that I bought these curtains and by the time I went to check out the price had gone up almost double. I wanted them so bad for a party that I just continued with my order a bit skeptic although when I received the curtains they were great quality and made the entire room feel so much like Christmas! Well worth it! Minus to extremely high price. perfect addition to my holiday decor Beautiful backdrop for photos Love these curtains. Very pretty.  Easy to hang. Lightweight. Help make our photos look more professional! It\\'s exactly as the picture shows; A real pleasure to look at. Fabric is light weight and is good quality in my opinion. Colour picture is one sided, white on the back. These worked out well and color was accurate. I used the as a Halloween backdrop. Good quality Love these curtains for the cozy feeling they will give you. Love these curtains. When I close midnight I feel like I\\'m living in the forest a red Forest LOL very nice material Beautiful drapes! The fabric is heavy, not flimsy, and the printed image is realistic. I am actually planning to use it for a theatrical backdrop along with several more drapes by this company. Likes it Love the curtains, looks great in my appartment and provides perfect privacy Beautiful, just right! I love them They are perfect, they look better than the displayed pic.... I love this - they are beautiful! The product is not worth the price. It looks so cheap compared to the cheaper ones I have. Wouldn\\'t recommend buying it. Love this. Very unique, good quality Todo precioso! Gracias It came with a big stain on the back which I had not realized originally Product as advertised.  Had these for a while now and product seems very well constructed.  Love the colors and material.  Hang very nicely They are great. Perfect curtains Beautiful!!! Very nice drapes, thick but allow light to come through. &nbsp;Soo. Good Living room windows Looks great in the living room<br>Goes good with the decor and doorway Looks great Thank You The material is thick... they are gorgeous... Looks great in my sons room. Love them! Love love love this drapery! Got it for the living room to let more light into the room even when the drapes are closed. The material is very nice and will last for sure. Exactly what I wanted It’s very colorful, and nice soft material I purchased these curtains and duvet cover for my preteen and we love it!  It transformed her room from a little girl\\'s room to a big kid room.  The quality is great and the colors are so vivid. Wonderful print but had to return it as the edges were kind of crooked. It kind of curled on the edges and didn’t drape well. Got another one in Italy landscape print and that didn’t have this problem or at least the busy print didnt reveal the problem. The plain white/blue on the edges enhanced the crooked look . . . just didn\\'t like the texture, too synthetic looking. Looks like plastic in person, not cloth. Wouldn\\'t recommend. It did not look like the website on the windows an the panels did not match No Se Nota La Foto De Los Edificios Muy Borrosa No Me Justo Para Nada Las Voy A Devolver I love these curtains they added a lot to my Christmas decor Love the texture and the size (108x108) is perfect for what I tried to do. The colors are vivid but the bottles, glasses, grapes are very weak.  Product is nothing like what is displayed. I thought this was a pair of short curtains when I ordered them. I really loved them. It was an unexpected addition to my decor. Finally found the curtains I was looking for love love love Awesome view ! Great back drop for pictures and very nice These curtains were like a shower curtain type material, and for the money they cost was not worth it! Very disappointed! Excellent product. Exactly as pictured. Sturdy fabric. Beautiful scene. Highly recommend. Everything about my curtains is perfect, the quality is perfect. I bought these for my large laundry room in the house. It was a perfect addition, touch of color and happiness. The only thing I had to adjust was getting a white curtain that blocked out the light, this is see through at night. Otherwise, live them! I ordered 107 x 90 and they are very beautiful...amazingly so considering the size!  When seen from the back you have another fantastic view of the same scene too (in reverse).  I liked them so much I ordered a second set of a different scene for another location.  Material is good quality too.  Items arrived in a thick plastic bag to precent damage in shipping. Sturdy material, beautiful color and design. I LOVE this curtain. I love this fabric! Hangs up easy! But it\\'s pink btw  Feels cheap for the price. Looks great! Not long enough,the material was very stiff. They’re okay for a closet the material is a little shiny. Nice sceene. How real they look Not as vibrant or focused as the photo. Fabric is very shiny. Just didn\\'t work for my purposes, but might for others. Returning. Used these as a room divider for my mother who is in memory care. The fabric is sturdy, they reach almost to the floor with no extensions and the scene is soothing for Mom. The curtains felt very cheap and the image definitely was not as crisp and clear as in the picture! I returned immediately. I have a large picture window and these curtains fit perfectly.  Love the farmhouse and windmill.  I purchased a second pair (which I cut in half) for two dining room windows.  Love them! Love it:) Looks great on my livingroom. Great curtain. The curtains are described as white and black. I received curtains that are blue and white. Cane I exchange them for the right ones? My favorite addition to Christmas decor this year! They are beautiful and were the best conversation pieces! Listed in one type of hanging system { pinch pleated} turned out to rod hung yet that was never mentiond in the description I decided to add some fun Christmas curtains this year. These were a hit. Loveee it Cute.  Wish they were shorter but overall they get me so many compliments.  I will buy another pair for my dining room Really cool looking  The curtains look really nice, it brighten up the living room , got a lot of compliments Love it, so unique Awesome , beautiful material It\\'s not satin. It\\'s 100% polyester. They are definitely not blackout. But really they do a great job and are stunning when it’s light out behind the fabric. They are numbered 1&amp;2 to ensure you get the pattern right. Overall I am very happy  Absolutely love these curtains.  The scenery is very real looking.  It also blocks the sunlight.  I feel the tranquility of being in the forest.  For all my nature peeps, you know what I’m talking about. These curtains are very good quality. Will buy more Muy lindas, buen producto These are absolutely spectacular. The material is good &amp; the artwork as well, and for the price I couldn\\'t ask for more. good Bright, vivid colors! I loved these curtains<br> I bought them too long<br>They make me smile everytime I see them These curtains add a rustic look to your room.  They are easy care and lightweight, hanging nicely and wrinkle free.  They are not room darkening and do allow quite a bit of light to come through.  Overall I really enjoy them. Christmas This went well with my sons nursery and it was long enough for each windows. Love how it brings the room color out(which is a bright green). I love the privacy this brings and a bit of the outside in. I feel like I’m at the beach. Love them! Loved the winter feel it gave me in florida weather. Absolutely beautiful! Fits window perfect, well made and worth every penny. When the light comes through them... It\\'s like you\\'re on  a warm Carribean Beach! I love theseand will be buying more!! Just perfect Very lovely and easy to hang Used in our sons room. He really likes them. Help<br>With the brightness The set I received was not the product in photo.  Each of my panels were two individual images as opposed to being two that joined as one.  That is a shame because both the image and feel of product  are exceptional.  I might try to find a alternate use for them but it\\'s difficult because I dont want the same image in two different areas.  And I\\'m not sure if I should try an exchange either. These curtains are absolutely beautiful! Once I\\'ve hung them up, I will upload a photo. They are on the heavier side, and very well made. The graphics are very well designed and brightly displayed. Long panels that block out all signs of sunlight which is perfect for a bedroom. My son is extremely excited to have these put up in his room! I am very satisfied with these curtains. A great add to any space themed room you have in mind! Loved them!  Not light and not heavy.  Perfect! It would have been nice if the had each side of the curtain stand alone. The Solar System title across the front is missing its s in system due to the carelessness of sewing. All in all my son loves it, I am just disappointed at the quality of overall image presentation. They could easy stand alone as a left and a right but still conveying the same solar system image. Work great to keep out cold. Blocks view through window so no one can see in. Loved it looks great  Nice graphics Delevery was wonderful.  The curtains are good color &amp; great quality.  I wish it was in 102\" length because the 96\" is too short for my tall windows. Definitely NOT blackout. They are privacy for sure but they let a good amount of light through. The material is okay, not as good as expected, feels more like a shower curtain blend than a heavy curtain. Pretty design though and easy to clean. Ordered 2 sets. The colors and length was different. These curtain are perfect in my Paris decor in my dining room BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS LOVE IT Look cheap Too short, very see through, not the correct length. Had to send back. Our walls and ceilings are all native wood and with windows on one side and these curtains on the other wall, it is almost like being outdoors. Nice. Temporary fix until we decide about closet doors. Surprised how good they look, Good quality material very pleased my .oms on hospice she wanted an ocean theme room, it looks Amazing Love them Love them . Nice clean white, color is brilliant.  I would buy again. Absolutely love these curtains in my sons room, looks so kool and is totally worth it. Can hardly wait for next Christmas to use these beautiful curtains.  Very vibrant color, amazing quality, at a great price.  What more could you ask for.  Oh, and very fast shipping.<br>Love these curtains, thinking of ordering another pair.<br>Pam Loved the look of these in daughters room. They are not room darkening though. Beautiful and great quality These curtains look exactly as advertised and the material is not flimsy. Everyone who sees them loves how they look. Will definitely order from this company again! Exactly like pictures. Good, but too pricey Really bring out my home daycare I would not recommend these curtains.  The colors were faded. Doesn\\'t look anything like picture.  I returned them. i hope this will help as I didn\\'t see it in previous reviews. Fabric is SHINNY. It is 100% polyester. My assumption was that it would be a matte textured fabric which would have better suited this type of botanical pattern. Therefore, the pattern appears \"crisper\" than I expected and overall thinner and flatter. Shinny is more for a delicate and refined aesthetics, which is not what I was looking for. But the curtain is of GREAT QUALITY, nicely sawed and if the finish does not rebuff you, they are great panels. Pattern appear larger in real life than on picture, colors are slightly brighter than on picture as well. I put 3 stars because I did not intend for a shinny polyester fabric. Love the look. Just what I want it works fine On the picture it has two leopards one on each curtain<br>When i recieved it. There\\'s only one leopard on the curtain:-(<br>Very misleading Very nice &amp; good quality Awesome, placed in my double livingroom windows There nice curtains, but wouldn’t  work on my windows to block out light. Very easy to clean I love these will be buying done more They went above and beyond my expectations. Thick, light blocking, not transparent at all. Very vibrant colors. LOVE them! It was the best! Looks like a barn door On the pic it shows two people facing each other. There was only one lady although there are two panels and she blows to her right. The panels are extremely wide, so if there were two you need a really extremely wide window to get the effect shown. My width is 107 and I love it. It\\'s beautiful and a show stopper for my home. You also can see her shadow outside the window at night from any light in your home. She\\'s the centerpiece and we are building our living room around her. Also look carefully, because later I found her in colors not just black and white which was the only one offered under my selection. These curtains gave off an appearance as a ugly shower curtain instead of a living or dining room curtain which I intended on using them for. They arrive and the quality was terrible however this set would cover a large window without gathering For Grand daughters room Perfect for Christmas time, will used them again next season Looks like the picture LOVE these curtains! The colors are rich and vibrant. Goes great in my Africa themed room Great pop of color. I used as an accent curtain only. Pretty well made, I didnt see any issues with the craftsmanship. When the room is light up and its dark outside, you can see the pattern from outside looking in, just fyi. Beautiful and really makes the room bright and lifts your spirits. A bit spendy, but nice quality. Heavy duty curtains that look nice when hung up. Bella como en la foto , entrega en tiempo Pleased with the product purchased!  Shipped quickly and great price. Nice They look like a mural, awesome  We love this curtain in our living room! Very nice, liked them so much that I purchased another set. Awesome courtine. Wife loves them.  Came sooner than expected. These look just like the picture. I had seen a previous review that showed the color difference but that\\'s because the customer matched the 2 sides backwards. The darker side goes on the left and gradually lightens to match the lighter right side perfectly. These aren\\'t thermal though. Not sheer or lightweight but there\\'s no backing to keep out cold or light. I put an extra backing on them to keep the cold out. Was disappointed that I had to send this back. Style not as expected. Material seems cheap and was not the style I was going for! Preciosa, con un colorido espectacular de este paisaje marino tan real.<br>El material es excelente.<br>Tal cual se ve en el anuncio. Disappointed  received this instead of the correct product Real show piece.  Love it. Not what the picture looks like .the print looks printed to the extreme Looks great, I really love it Excellent quality and looks great! Brightens up room and is beautiful. Exactly what I was looking for to add color to my bedroom. Very cute design that goes great with our girls\\' new bedroom theme. Bright colors with soft material as described,  but very thin! While I knew they weren\\'t blackout curtains, I hoped they would block some light... they do not. Quality is excellent. Beautiful scene. The sun does shine thru so if you don\\'t want that youll have to put another curtain behind this or something else. Screen printing a little blurry... meh I love these curtains! They give a western feel to my living room. So beautiful and vibrant. Will give your space a pleasant natural feeling since it is so real! The fall colors really brings out the living room area. Looks really nice and colorful. Need dark curtains behind it though, semi-see through at night. I like The printed design is as colorful and distinct as advertised.  The fabric is terrible.  The creases were so bad that first I ironed it; then I washed it and ironed it again...twice. The creases and wrinkles are still visible though to a lesser degree but it is due to the type of fabric. The fabric remains stiff and does not drape well, and the shiny satin makes all those wrinkles stand out even more. I was surprised how good this really looks in person! I put it up to divide a conference room from cubes. It looks great these really do look nice. Worth the money!!!!! Not as pictured or described. More the texture of a shower curtain than a window dressing. I was surprise how the quality of the printing was and dimension are exactly what we needed.  We love it, this makes our small room feel bigger and relaxing especially when we look at the curtain. The curtains are a perfect fit for my patio. reminds me of my hometown. nice vibrant colors just like the picture. Used as a closet ‘door’. Looks great! Exactly what I need I put them up in my living room over the sliding glass door that we do not use.  They look awesome Colors are vibrant and rich. Picture is clear.  Fabric has some weight to it. Very happy with it.  Not black out, but fairly opaque. During daylight, the picture glows. Beautiful It\\'s not red it\\'s pink.. really wanted red These curtains are eye catching. They are art work. I had sheer curtains before because I wanted let light in but I could see the neighbors house. This curtain has transformed my living room into a tropical paradise. I did add a layer of gold sparkling string curtains over it. Topixdeals Rare Flat Silver Ribbon Door String Curtain Thread Fringe Window Panel Room Divider Cute Strip Tassel Party Events (1 Pack, Champagne) At night when the light is on it looks really beautiful. I get so many compliments on this curtain. It is total privacy yet lets the light in. Nice Love them. That are exactly as described. The image of the horses is beautiful!!! I love these curtains.  They provide privacy but let plenty light into the room. The picture of these curtains do not do them justice, there absolutely gorgeous!! I highly recommend these curtains to anyone who would like to brighten a bedroom!!! Love these curtains!! Kinda pricey These curtains are very nice. They don’t block out the sun but I don’t mind having some light in the room. Love it! Get lots of compliments! No me gusto , las cortinas tienen diseño diferente muestran dos chicas en las cortinas y solo tienen una sola Absolutely love these curtains!! I should have listened to the 1 star reviewer (Miguel) for this. He was correct and I also got a curtain that looks unlike the pic. It\\'s super faded in comparison, the pattern is stretched out and it looks cheap and crappy. It\\'s barely worth 20 bucks, let alone the 70 I paid (63+tax). Returning it and never buying this brand and from this seller again. When I walk into my living room I wanted something that was busy, active,  and different. Love the fact that they have something from my heritage, Rasta This is very nice high quality  the picture is just awesome They are gorgeous and I love the material it\\'s silky.  4 starts because it didn’t look exactly like picture but still pretty Adorable. Could be a little bit lighter/brighter in color.<br>I hung it on my kitchen sliders. Heavy material, beautiful image. Absolutely beautiful! I was looking for curtains to complete my office. Unlike most, this would be used for my meditation corner. Let me tell you, these did not disappoint! Exactly as described with even more detail in the colors! They provide a very serene feel. They are not too heavy and the pattern is amazing. We bought this for church. We are a portable church which means we put up and take down our things each week to prepare for church. This was bought for our preschool environment and it is working out wonderfully! We love it!! I absolutely love these curtains.  When the sun is shining the tigers themselves are bright and stand out from the background! They are absolutely gorgeous and I am well satisfied with them. I will buy from this seller again with anticipation on receiving my items. AWESOME JOB! Just love my curtain Very unique. Change the look of the area. Love it picture as shown. Love the waterfall colors The image was awesome. Very disappointed with this item. For the price I paid I expected it to be better quality than it is. It feels and looks like a shower curtain instead of feeling and looking like a window curtain. I won\\'t be buying anything else from this company. Love it...I bought the wrong size. I sent it back and am waiting for the right size. I really love the way it looked can’t wait to actually hang the correct one  I decided to keep them even though the advertisement and the actual curtain look different because I just really wanted to wake up to my goals everyday, it not that bad. Nice product. Pictures accurately represented the pproduct. It\\'s ok for a camp Not fitting a average size window to too big The print is of high quality.  The material is thicker than I thought it would be and of great quality.  I put these on the sunny side of the house, they give the room a nice ambient glow and look great doing it.  The back side is plain white, should reflect a lot of the suns heat away.  And they are heavy enough to help block the winter cold from entering the room.  Made in Turkey surprisingly. I’m using this as a room divider between My I’m acupuncture office and living space. It looks great!!! I would have preferred cotton, but really, the design and colors are perfect. Tbese drapes don\\'t look anything like the drapes in the photo. It isn\\'t the same image and the colors are very faded. Horrible for the price paid. Super cute!!! Came just as expected!!! No gimmicks!! Color was stated as black and brown.  Actual was navy and pink.  yuck Looks awsome adds personality great when sun is shinning thru. Unfortunately I had to return it as it was too big for my bedroom window, description is not clear but honestly if you want it for larger windows its best and so cheap price wise comparatively and stuff is good, its not 100% room darkening , and that’s another reason I had to return it. It\\'s beautiful  , exactly as pictured  .<br>Material is heavier than I  thought it would be.<br><br>ABSOLUTELY love it !!!! Put these in my bedroom.  Beautiful A+ Much thicker material than I expected. Bright and colorful. Happy that I made the purchase! Decent quality for $40. Not as dark as the picture but still looks pretty nice. Good enough resolution, bright and colorful...good fabric! The curtains came quickly. I ordered the curtains for the bedroom. I was impressed with the quality of the material and the Beautiful Tropical picture. I liked it so well,I ordered another exact pair for the living room. For my house Fabric not as expected. Not very soft Simplemente hermosas I used it for my main attraction in living room looks so beautiful I\\'ve got many many compliments. Thank you. I haven’t put them up but let me tell you if you are hesitate like I was; don’t be. These curtains are beautiful and does block a little light. I’m not using mine as a curtain more as a calming room divider. If I can add an updated review I will. The colors are bold, the picture is vivid and makes you instantly feel relaxed as you would in the woods near a waterfall. I’m soooooo happy with this purchase. Extremely poor quality, and no value for your money whatsoever. Additionally, the seller offers no returns or exchanges. Great quality Beautiful! Nice quality. Totally changes the way a room feels. LOVE them! The graphic on this was great. Clear &amp; crisp. Very dark, but it won\\'t block light.<br>Very heavy material,  Would work great with insulted, light blocking liner These curtains are beautiful! A lot of the reviews were saying they were see-thru or not a great quality. I 100% disagree. They are the perfect touch for my son’s forest theme bedroom. They really transport you and make you feel like you are in the forest. The colors are vibrant and the scene flows seamlessly. (I received no compensation for this review, I just really love them and almost did not purchase because of other reviews. I’m glad I went ahead and purchased them) Stunning print quality. Offers excellent clarity during day time with light from back side. This is really like a shower curtain.  It was a total ripoff.  Then, Amazon told me I had to pay to return it even though it said it was a free return.  Never buy this. They look great but are not black out!  They are nice and are darkening but if you want to keep the room dark these will not do it Beautiful curtain I love it so much! I couldnt take my children to Paris? Who said so? We sure as hell went to Paris, visited the Eiffel tower, loved evrrymomenttoffitt and made magical memories! Fit perfect! Very well made Great material! Thick and good quality. Just wish they had longer lengths. Print looks good and seems to be good quality on first inspection. Not light blocking if that is what you want, but the light that comes through looks pretty neat. These curtains had the Circle Rustic Gate Opening scene and were perfect for my son\\'s Asian themed apartment.  He liked that some light filtered in, but that they were not sheer.  They block glare if you have a window whose light  impacts your TV screen or computer.  They are of a nice heavier material than expected.  Very nice quality, and the scene is vivid.  When the light filtered through them, it truly looked like you were looking into a serene Asian garden through the circular wooden gate.  They drape beautifully - if you prefer the curtains to touch the floor.  Would buy these again from this seller. In love !!! Elegant !! Excellent quality !! ❤️❤️❤️ So beautiful!!!!!!! Great quality !!! In love! From a distance they’re fine but within six feet you can see dark and light horizontal lines. Absolutely beautiful! So very pleased with this product I ordered in two different styles I do wish this was available in real cloth like cotton.....but it’s for a bathroom so works great...I love it...Karen Beautiful, placements to match. Very cheap flimsy material! Looks like a shower curtain  from the dollar store!! Absolutely Beautiful! It doesn\\'t only show the full affect when the sun is shining, but the just daylight in itself gives the curtain a stunning view. At this time michigan is under quarantine so to be able to look at that beautiful view that looks 3D, gives me a surrealist imagination and feel. I ended up returning this. I thought it would be a great piece over my sliding back door. The light was shining through it and it was very pointless. Love these curtains,  nice weight, great pattern, just like pictured.<br>These really make the design of my room feel very woodsy and peaceful.  I will tell you,  there\\'s quite a bit of black or dark brown, exactly as shown, but it may be a surprise to someone who thinks there\\'s more light in the pattern.  Very happy. These were perfect for my dragon loving grand daughter. Fit right in with her collection of dragons. Kindof just looks like a gray blob....it\\'s SUPER hard to see that it\\'s a castle staircase.... It\\'s all we need for the design. Absolutely love them.  My living room looks so much different now.  I bought them to help keep out the cold air and they have done their job!  I have bought most all my drapes from Amazon and I haven\\'t been disappointed yet!  Love them all!  The curtain was beautiful, but I had to return it due to the shiny fabric not matching the atmosphere of the room. Faded They covered windows and wall in bedroom dedicated to cowboy theme.  Really different.  Like the look. Love this curtain. The colors appear as advertised. Length and width does not disappoint... I love this! It looks so beautiful in my room. It lets light in very naturally. They look awesome. Fit the area perfectly. Exactly what we needed for baby room Would have been awesome if they didn’t mail me two different colors of beach backgrounds... Bear is soooo low on material<br>Terrible craftsmanship I had to hem them but they are beautiful. Can\\'t afford the view every day in or on a real beach but I can afford it in my house through my windows I can\\'t afford to live at the beach but I can always look at it with these These curtains looked great in my gym reading Room. every time I\\'m stressed out I just think I\\'m on the beach I love these curtains so much !  They are everything I had hoped they would be and then some.  Quality is great, printing is great, love them. These are awesome, they really give the room a gothic feel. My only complaint is that they had a strong smell like new carpet at first. They look great though! Love the satin quality thick material- print was vibrant in focus and just as pictured. Perfect! It was on the big size and the picture quality wasn\\'t the best These curtains were very soft, very white, very nice.  I ordered for my patio door and really wanted sheer.  They are lined.  Plus in the picture it showed one dock.  When they arrived it was two panels and two docks which didn\\'t look right.  Otherwise they are very nice!  I appreciate the quick ability to return them for credit. Look nothing like picture. Overpriced These curtains look just like the picture, so I was not deceived.  My only problem with the designer of these curtains, is that they don\\'t make them wide enough for wider windows, so they can\\'t close all the way.  That made no sense.  Also, because of the BEAUTY of this picture, I would have LOVED to have it cover more of the panel.  It\\'s striking, and we absolutely love these curtains! It\\'s beautiful and the price is right. The color is not the same as in the picture . It is a blue color not black. It is very misleading. I got these because they are the only ones that have any purple in them for a girls\\' room that I could find.<br>I actually expected a cheap screen print but these are very good quality, thick panels and look exactly as pictured.  They do let light through so the picture will look lighter with sun behind it.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend. will not return after a few weeks!!!! Fabric is thick and stiff will not slide on rod easy. probable for outdoor<br><br>I Am stuck with one I wanted to exchange!!!!! Love these real picture curtains. Great quality and thick it\\'s worth every penny  These curtains are even nicer in person. The colors are vibrant and the quality of the fabric is fantastic. They are such a nice addition to my son\\'s bedroom! Soft and cute! Really helped to create a room for a preteen whose a gamer I love Ambesonne  Shower curtains, bed spreads, curtains - so much variety and color for the decorator with flair. They look really nice. I may need to steam them if the wrinkles do not fall out Amazing theme curtains.  Quality fabric, nice weight.  Has the weigh of drapery.<br><br>Love them and want to buy one for each season. They are really nice looking! Computer picture doesn’t match actual piece well These are absolutely gorgeous and the patterns on each panel line up perfectly. Nice thickness. Perfect design,  it\\'s beautiful and well made. Very unique and perfect for what I am looking for We used this product at are lake house for a room divider to cover up hanging coats. And it looks great bought a closest  rod for mounting<br>Very easy install,. Fell in love with them as soon as I saw the listing. Have been looking for a 108” long curtains for a long time. Price was deeply discounted, which was great!<br>Fabric is thick and nice, print is very beautiful!<br>Happy! Thank you! These curtains are amazing! The trees, leaves, lighting it\\'s just incredible. The first set I ordered I returned because I thought the curtain on the left was printed incorrectly as there are some leaves that were blank just showing the white material.  I think the computer they use to print these curtains interpreted the sunlight hitting certain leaves as those white spots. Well I returned it and reordered it.  The second set of curtains arrived and it\\'s the same thing. I have now ordered some dry acrylic paint sticks and I\\'m going to see if I can match the greens and yellows in these few small areas. My living room is small and it just might be that I\\'m too close to these curtains allowing my eye to be caught by the white showing up on some of the leaves compared to a much larger room where they would be seen from a greater distance. From the outside of the house through the sliding glass door all you see are white curtains. But in my living room the light coming through during the day really shows the detail. Even at night with the porch light on outside you can see the detail.  I\\'m still giving this 5 stars! Happy with purchase I Actually Like My Curtains.  My Only Issue Is That The Picture Describing How It Looks Doesn\\'t Actually Match What Was Sent.<br>(Photo Description has more detail it almost looks textured. Actual one you get is okay. 1 ⭐ away from 5=looks different from actual picture advertising it. I was super excited to get these for my daughter beachy room. I wanted to surprise her on her birthday and I put the curtains up only to notice that they are both one side. Instead of a left side and right side I got 2 left sides. Beautiful curtains. These curtains are very beautiful and well-made! My cat loves to sit in them by the window! They are comforting and give a little feel of the shore! I highly recommend them! These curtains are well-made and beautiful! They give me comfort. I like how some sunlight comes through them during the day. Beautiful addition to my bedroom! Heavy material but the picture is blurry and over zoomed, 2 sets curtains, the same problem twice love these curtains I received 2 panel for the same side. I can not use it. Waste of money Gorgeous curtains, light filters through This actually looks like the photo...<br>This is actually on a wall in my new apt. I wanted something decorative but not \\'dogs playing poker\\' or black light Led Zeppelin or Elvis on black velvet. My lighting is too dim through the tinted glass here for real plants. It provides a natural serenity. I\\'m very pleased Used on the daily. =O) These are perfect for my windows. Sure beats looking out at the side of my neighbors house.<br>They are white on the back side but it let\\'s the light in enough to keep the room from being dark. Because they are a bit larger in width than my windows the gathering makes a 3D effect in the scene.<br>I\\'ll buy other scenes for other seasons.  They are a great decorating accessory. Love the colorful energy from these curtains. They are a little thin; however, they are the perfect addition to our funky music room. left panel was the correct one I ordered, but the right panel was from a different set, so it did not match. will be returning. I was absolutely excited and actually looks amazing in my living room.<br>A very happy lady!!! Pleasantly surprised with how beautiful these curtains are.<br>I have vaulted ceilings and these are still longer.<br>Not returning, I’m using theres curtains as a wall mural so it still worked out. These curtains are well made and easy to hang up. The curtain hole is big so they will fit with bigger curtain rods. The picture is pretty and not blurred although I wish this was a southern deer and not a northern one (it looks like a llama) But still great curtains. Light shines through them and makes the scene look more real. These curtains are nice, although the picture on the website and the actual product are very different. The bears are really big and to make it look like the one on the website you would have to put it on the other end of a football field. The bears are beautiful but the back ground of the trees are blurred. The separation is on the momma bears eye. I have blinds up so only a little light shines through them. They are well made and have a big hole for curtain rods. The curtains are different sizes but only by 1/2 so most people won\\'t notice it. They come packed in a snap together plastic bag and upon hanging them up any creases fall out. These are so pretty and life like. Everyone that comes over cant believe that its a curtain &amp; not the real deal. I have mine stretched all the way out and not bunched like a normal curtain would hang because I wanted that life like effect. So worth the price you pay. I love the pattern and colors; however, the measurements need to read LENGTH x WIDTH Love the design and the colors game  semi-transparent = light will come through this but totally private; beautiful color image looks slightly digital up close but I don\\'t mind I love them! Packaging may have been a bit careless, I had a few marks on them black-ish dark gray, perhaps dust or sliding across dirty area WHILE putting them in package. I noticed it through the clear packaging, but washed as suggested, and hung them up. I have a triple rod assembly. One for them, one for room darkening behind and one for valance. You can barely notice the marks (most of it came off). I would like to show a picture, it\\'s actually nice. If I cannot go to the island beach, see palm trees and ocean, I will bring it home to me! This curtain really makes our room so cozy!!!  The material is wonderful and very easy to care for.  Would highly recommend :) high quality so much more beautiful than the pictures. I absolutely love them Fabulous curtains! Think material, durable, and elegant looking. I do not usually leave a review of things I buy on Amazon, but these curtains are so beautiful and add so much color and memories of Lake Tahoe and beache vacations to our home that I had to leave a review. The photos speak a volumes. Enjoy. Picture quality is fantastic. More then I expected So cute! They came a day early! Perfect size! Thicker than I imagined! Colors are perfect! Thank you Product is as described. I used them as closet curtains and removed the awkward sliding doors!  My 15 y.o old loves them! These are not what was pictured. I was expecting a mostly brown curtain. And I have a mostly ivory curtain. It is milk chocolate and gray. Not very good colors. Do not buy. Loved them! I grew up in the City and the image is just right!! Love them. Absolutely love it.  Vibrant colors.  Stapled each panel on side walls of toilet closet.  Love it. DO NOT ORDER<br> My order was canceled the day I was scheduled to receive the space curtains my son picked out for his new bedroom. Super pretty but if you\\'re using it to also block out light I wouldn\\'t recommend. I love the curtains...however...I wish the print was a little darker. When the light shines thru, it kinda washes out the color We got the barn door one. It looks great and makes a great addition to our kitchen. Good thick quality fabric. I could not even find a better, durable, excellent vibrant color in a curtain. Oh my grandsons were ecstatic. The picture is beautiful but it doesn\\'t compare to the actual curtains.  When you see the curtains, the heaviness, I just did not imagine the curtains being like this. My daughter hands over her mouth could not say a word, then she finally said. Mom you out did yourself theses are perfect.  I will purchase from this seller again and again. I love it it fit just right . They actually turned out great. I love them It’s different and I like it<br>( Looks just like picture) Friends and family enjoy this scenic curtains. It is perfect. Love it, very vibrant colors and the fit is perfect I did go one size up but worth. Bought the ones with horses in front of mountains for my son\\'s blue bedroom. They are great! I absolutely love these! wonderful product, quality surpassed my expectation.. will order again.. Definitely a wonderful product, description was outstanding, they are well made and very beautiful These curtains are so pretty. I appreciate the nice quality. I enjoy just looking at them. They have given the room such a cool feel. Very pretty but not blackout like it says very light sun comes through but beautiful These drapes are really cool looking and good quality. The only complaint is that they let in a lot of sunlight. They are more for decorative purposes than actually keeping light out. I absolutely ❤LOVE❤ these curtains!! I absolutely love me curtains. They keep the sun out when I want them to and still look great when opened to let the sun in. I really love my New curtains! Perfect size and good quality! Buen material y hermoso paisaje Buen material hermosos colores la tengo hace un año y todavía se ve como nueva Using this as a backdrop at my daughters woodland theme wedding. Didn\\'t want to spend a fortune for a one time use.  Very pleased when it came. Material is heavy duty.  Picture is nice.  It will work perfectly. Great look and heavy weight. It’s perfect! Looks great. I purchased the \"Silhouette of a Tree on Hill with Sun...\" and the colors are super vibrant! My daughter loves them! The fabric is good quality and well sewn. Looks cute for my laundry room entry door I like the picture I simply LOVE my curtains!!!  So lifelike! I do feel like they are a little<br>Expensive, but they look amazing. They do let light through but I just bought black blackout curtains to go behind them and it’s perfect! I was super excited to try these curtains!  They are the colors I was looking to include in my room, but the curtains lay weird.  They are a poofy, slippery material that doesn\\'t lay flat, and have no way of flattening down to frame a window in any flattering way.  I am returning these as soon as I can! Product is just as described absolutely beautiful. Used in master bedroom My hubby &amp; I feel so refreshed every time we look at them. Such a gorgeous, peaceful view! We were very impressed with their thickness and privacy lining. Great choice &amp; great buy! Fun to have different ones to change 2 or 3x a yr with the seasons. So thankful to have run across Ambesonne after all these yrs. Very good product I love everything about my curtains. I returned it. It does not block sun. You can see right through material. Great quality Muy hermosas bien material Love these. They look amazing when the sun shines through them. like how they look, very good buy highly recommended. Love the memories these panels bring back of family time on the beach.  Great for use on my son\\'s closet in lieu of doors.  That said, the image is very blurry.  Only one small area of grass tips are in focus so the problem is with the photograph rather than the printing which appears to be of decent quality.<br>Nice fabric weight though having difficulty getting the creases out from the folded packaging.<br>For the low price I would say they are fun to have in a casual use but I would not put them anywhere else in our home.  3 1/2 stars if I could I had black and gray curtains in my living room before I bought these. The room felt so dark. I wanted something brighter but I also didn\\'t want people to see into my living room at night. These are perfect for that. I\\'m beyond happy with my purchase. Too big and its nothing like the picture, I\\'m not happy at all These curtains look awesome, and my son loves them. Not completely wrinkle-free, but I\\'m not complaining - just stating the facts. =) I like that they are heavy enough that you can\\'t see through them at night when the lights are on in the room!  Perfect for my bo-ho style!  Washes without getting all wrinkly and the design set up matches! Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful My son Love these curtains. They look just like the picture but I wish they came in a shorter height because the football image is on the floor and not stopping at the panel like the picture. I was expecting cheap curtains because they’re inexpensive. They are great quality and super cool! I absolutely love my new drapes.  They are slightly permeable as you can see a silhouette at night but it lets in just enough light to look magical in the daytime.  Image is sharp and feels amazing Cute and did what I needed it to do . Super fast ship as well Material is premium and heavy. Looking forward to the additional print I purchased to arrive! material is nice, vibrant color and heavier than I anticipated.  It fit the curtain rod nicely and is well sewn. Liked. But color not as brilliant  as was showed. Absolutely gorgeous!!  Love them These curtains are cute but hardly light blocking, even with my blinds! I will need a liner or to choose traditional light blocking solid color curtains. These curtains are beautiful in person. Pictures don\\'t really capture it. My husband installed these over our front window with pallet wood above and when they are closed, it looks like a giant wooden door. When the lights come on out front, the door almost glows, like in a video game. Pretty awesome! Absolutely Beautiful! I love all of my Ambesonne curtains, and these are just as great as the ones I bought in 2017!<br>I bought these for my closet, because I can\\'t stand closet doors. At the \"living room\" size, they fit near perfectly. I have another set on my other closet &amp; both sets, along with my Ambesonne curtains on my bedroom windows, helps create a very comfortable atmosphere.<br>The curtains are pretty much perfect right out of the bag. I took them out &amp; put them on a tension rod and easily put them into place (2nd picture), which was to replace \"galaxy\" curtains also by Ambesonne.<br>I decided I didn\\'t like them on that closet door, so I switched the Ambesonne \"mystic portal\" &amp; these, and Ta-da! The flow I wanted was created. The second picture shows the current position, at night, with a 40 watt equivalent LED soft light on. How freaking awesome does that look?! It\\'s fantastic for me, helping me to wind down, relax, and prepare for sleep.<br><br>Whether day or night, windows or closets, Ambesonne curtains continue to be a big \"win\" for me. They\\'re a heavier fabric, so some light show through (which makes the scenery beautiful), but not black out. They\\'re well sewn &amp; beautifully printed. Ambesonne has a wide variety for all kinds of \"flavors.\" No need for boring curtains!<br><br>**I am NOT compensated in any way, form, or fashion for this review. I truly am extremely happy with this brand and I highly recommend their curtains. I like this product. They look beautiful and material is good quality. It is a thick material. Im happy.. love it Beautiful Cute closet curtain, my daughter loves it! I bought this to do Live Virtual Magic Shows and with proper lighting it pops and looks 3D.  It really looks amazing, is a much thicker quality material than I was expecting and the colors are bright.  I will be purchasing additional backdrops from your company. When product arrived, I LOVED it. But, then I found out that I ordered the wrong length.  I immediately returned it with absolutely no problem at all.  Return went a lot smoother than I thought it would. Very important to me.  I believe that the product comes in only one width, which is way wider than I need.  However, I was able to take in the width, some, because I do sew. Love the curtain.  At Christmas time, It will add interest to my sliding door off of my dinning room. It\\'s like our daughter\\'s room now overlooks the ocean!  We took down my daughter\\'s bi-fold closet doors and replaced with these curtains.  The curtains are easier for her to operate and do not protrude into the room when opened (so space-saving).  The curtains make my daughter\\'s room look bigger because of the illusion created by the expansive view. We were really excited to put these curtains up when they finally arrived, opened the box, and what do we find? Two of the same curtain....two halves of the same dock. We have to return and there are none of these currently available to reorder. Very disappointed! I was very impressed. These are not as measured.  104 across by 109 long. Just incase you need the exact width for your window. 4 inches short on with. Love it Return already ! Color too dark for me Love these curtains! Even better when the wrinkles fall out. I should have ordered 90\" but my fault.<br>Made small guest room look so much bigger.  Am ordering a set for the fall. I loved the way it look. I looked amazing and when the sun it it make it more alive. Beautiful! Great quality Beautiful!  I am very satisfied.  They are well made.  Very vibrant colors. They brighten up my living room letting light in while keeping the bright sun out. Saw some harsh reviews on the material. It’s not great but not bad either. We just hung them today but these are just what I’d hoped they were and the resolution is actually very good. First impression is I love these drapes! We LOVE these curtains. Just came in today. I washed them and dried them and hung them right away. I sent a photo of that part of the kitchen to a few family and friends. Lots of compliment. I\\'m doing an enchanted fairy them in our kitchen. These were perfect. Great, thick quality fabric. Thank you! I love cats and also dia de los Muertos.  The idea of celebrating (not mourning) the family you have lost is not something that people here in the US can relate to.  But I can!  I love the colors of the cats against the white backdrop of the curtains.  I still have more to put up!  Thanks! Those are exactly what we were expecting and will be something my sons can use for years to come. I got this for my living room and it looks gorgeous. It’s color is just like the image on the site. The material is a satin like thick cloth. Seems like it could be water resistant. I haven’t washed it yet so I hope it holds up when I do. It is great for my purpose and brightens the room. I would buy it again. These curtains were purchased for a bedroom. They are perfect. Nice quality. I would recommend these curtains. Love these curtains. Nice and thick. Not tacky. Brightens the room and also keeps the light out (if that makes sense) good quality for the price. I got these curtains (the beach scene) to hang in my living room as a backdrop for all the Google Meets I had to do with my class during distance learning.  They are very vivid and give me a little piece of the beach while I am stuck indoors! They are good quality and look just like the picture. There is something about them they I\\'m not crazy about, but I just can\\'t seem to put my finger on what it is. They look like the picture and it goes well with my room. They were expensive. It is lovely.<br>The light filtered through it makes it so real.<br>If you\\'ve been to Spain, or Greece, you would feel you are there again, in the midst of it all.<br>Sorry to compare the two countries, but there are so many similarities that I find impossible to overlook. My closet is 12\\'x12\\'x2 1/2\\'. I needed curtains at least 93x98.  My house is older,1988, and had those horrid mirrored closet doors. The tracks finally gave out last year so I took them out. New doors would be a minimum of $1000 so I was looking for alternatives. I purchased a suspension rod and curtain clips (from Amazon too) to add length to these as they were 3 inches too short. I knew this buying them but wanted them anyway. I love these curtains! So much better than heavy doors and they add a serene effect. Total price for the curtains, clips and suspension rods was about $130. These were perfect.<br>Amazing , very nice quality.<br>Totally what I wanted!!!! very nice Artwork was beautiful. They were much thicker than I anticipated they would. Hard to handle and heavy when you placed them on the rod. Wife likes this a lot.  A little bit of the Caribbean in our house.  It fits over a standard curtain rod, and the two panels fit our 6\\' wide picture window. Absolutely in love with these curtains. They have brought Italy to our living room. My teenage girls thought I was nuts but they love them in person too. You have to see to believe. I say life is short, bring a little happy and unexpected into your home. I can\\'t express enough how much I love these curtains! I\\'ve been transported to Italy. The colors are just as vivid as pictured in ad although it\\'s not showing in my personal picture. Looked and felt like shower curtains Ok , so I was pretty iffy about getting these. I looked at them a million times , read reviews , wasn’t crazy about other reviewers pics. The pics did not do justice to them. I have them in a large room on glass doors , they keep out the sun , but aren’t too dark , the trees are beautiful and make me happy These are pretty nice curtains and they didn’t break the bank. They feel thick and smooth and provide good shade and privacy. I would buy them again. Nice but not blocking the light from outside and I  over paying for this curtains very nice! returned These are beautiful. The fabric is thick and hides my laundry/pantry area. The colors are beautiful. They were super easy to hang. Love that they have the side curtain holders too. Looks great. I have it in my sons room. Everyone loves it I absolutely love these curtains I am so glad that I purchased them. They are very very bright and vibrant. I bought these for my bedroom because I\\'m doing ocean themed however I think I\\'m going to buy some for my living  after seeing these. would give these curtains 10 Stars if I could honestly. I couldn\\'t be happier with my purchase. I don\\'t usually leave reviews but I am so impressed and got so many compliments on these curtains that I had to leave one. I love these curtains and they are so beautiful and remind me so much of the islands back home in Tonga that I hung these in my living room. My chair is right across from these curtains and I get to enjoy them every day!!! Thank you Ambesonne and Amazon!! Definitely 5  Love it These curtains are BEAUTIFUL!  I put a leafy sheer curtain in front and wanted the rainbow as a background and absolutely LOVE how it turned out! :). The rainbow curtains seem to glow when it’s daylight outside.  (They aren’t completely blackout like I had thought they would be and I’m very glad.). There is one thing that bugs me though, there’s a white spot about the size of a mango that has no color on it- like it was missed when they spray painted it or printed it (or however they made colored the fabric) and it’s right close to the center of the curtains so it’s quite obvious.  I don’t know if ALL of the curtains are just printed that way or if mine is defected. Because I like things to be perfect, I REALLY wish it wasn’t there... however, I don’t want to return them because 1) they are so pretty and DO like them 2) I don’t want to wait for weeks for more curtains and 3) the lace/sheer curtains on top help to hide the spot.  All that said, I would buy these curtains again as they are SUPER gorgeous vivid rainbow colors and made with a quality,  thick, ”silky-feeling” fabric. I love it.  I used them on a slider between my office and bedroom.  I wanted a cool background to videchat and relax to.  I wasnt expecting it to look so great on the bedroom side too.  It\\'s well made with a nice white liner. The colors appear vibrant.<br>I hung it with 2 very cheap rods, and they work perfect. Beautiful!! These curtains compliment and enhanced my living room ambiance. Well made. Im going to order more styles to compliment the kitchen and my bedroom. They are really nice, but for some reason one curtain is 4 inches longer than the other one, other then that they’re ok The curtains were so cute but DEFECTIVE!  The right panel was clearly three or more inches wider than the left panel.  I already bought a rug and other accessories for the room.  Exchanging and crossing my fingers. color nt as brilliant  as shown I love the curtains.  They are higher quality than I expected.  The do block light, but allow just enough when the sun hits them directly to make it look like the sun is shining through the trees. We do however have a huge Photinia bush that is in front of our window that is shielding some of the direct sun as well, so I can\\'t say for certain how much sun the curtains would block when the rays hit directly.  I will be getting more to periodically switch the scenes out. I returned because the quality of this curtain was not good and I did not get my refund yet. I loved my curtains. I brought two pair .  Then I brought a third pair. Beautiful nicely made but could be a little less expensive for the material they used The sewing is absolutely atrocious on these curtains. The seems in each corner is 2 to 3 inches shorter than in the middle and it looks very stupid. The seems on the edges are extremely rough. My 5 year old can sew better than this. thinking of ripping the stitches out and resewing but they cut the material wrong as well. Definitely NOT worth the money paid for this. Gorgeous! A little cheap looking but adds an amazing touch to my guestroom. Loved them Beautiful. Great quality curtains. We love the tranquility it gives us For me, it doesn’t look as cute as it does in the picture. I am looking for something new to replace it with Nice material, any wrinkle from packaging has quickly fallen out ... fun to have a door to another world beyond the window We needed to cover 16 feet of pantry racks so that things would look neater. We pull them back when working, and cover it all up when we\\'re done. I love these. Good quality. Will purchase another scene soon. Just what I wanted lights my room right up an nice print to look at Happy with our purchase! For those who are wondering if they are blackout curtains though, they are not. Exactly what I was looking for I love them but they don\\'t block out alot of light if that\\'s a problem for you then these aren\\'t what your looking for Very pretty.  Loved them.  Reason for 4 stars they look more white in ad but they were very darker blue with snow scene.  Lots more blue than snow. Good quality and I love the design. We used this as a scenic backdrop in our RV port.  It is beautiful and seems well made. Fits my massage room perfectly!! I love them!!! Looks even better in person! Very pretty,when your lights are on at night you can see the tree  from outside, I  recommend these curtains. Looks just like pic. I love it Didn’t look at measure n it is big Love the color the size the design beautiful thanks Amazon was perfect for what I needed When ordered does not look like the picture much. Only looks good on large window when light shines through Love my curtains Love it!!!! Even more beautiful in person. Love how when the blinds are open and the sunlight shines through and hits the curtain....truly makes it appear as if you are sitting on the dock and the sun is setting Beautiful recommend to anyone an everyone so beautiful in my living room The curtains are a hit. I was able to purchase matching rug as well. Really sets the movie theater mood. These curtains are truly so beautiful! I will agree with any positive review of this product. The quality. The beauty. Satisfaction guaranteed. Whatever your vision preference you will not be disappointed. BUY THESE CURTAINS!!!  They are much longer than I anticipated. I had to take off about 10 inches. Still, they get the job done. I love these curtains! They arrived quickly and they are beautiful to look at. Very well made and exactly as pictured. I highly recommend them. Works great in my home office as a back-drop for all those video conferences. I ordered the basketball hoop/brick wall one and it looks amazing in my sons man cave! Love it the best Curtains were shorter than expected Perfect living room cherry blossoms theme Absolutely love them!! Bought the curtains for my kids play room. We have the classic mirror closet sliding doors in our bedroom. I covered them with this beautiful curtain, and every morning we wake up with an amazing beach view. Love the feeling and ambiance it gives. It is great quality and I recommend it! I love love love these curtains they look so cool and are great quality. The design is so realistic. I used them to cover my pantry and they make my dinning area look amazing. Sent back because I didn’t need them Love these curtains adds charm unlike other run of the mill cheap curtains. I like the feel of the material too. Just not for dining or living room! Kind of disappointed because I don’t do the refund crap! Just gonna hang them in kids room It looks cool, but it does not black out the light. I\\'ll update this review in a couple of days to let you know if it reduces outside noise and helps regulate the temperature as advertised. These drapes are absolutely beautiful and the pictures don’t do them justice. The quality is amazing, but make sure you pay attention to what size length you order, because drunk me did not and now I have to order shorter ones. Curtains were 2 different colors Beautiful curtains Please on my balcony.. makes me feel like I’m on vacation Online it says burgundy.. however when i received it it was purple. This was a great disappointment. My husband is a vaporwave in thinks he is and absolutely loves them. Thank you I bought these during the pandemic to improve my limited environment. I enjoy them so much! Every morning I rediscover them upon waking and feel like a kid in my own secret garden. I was worried it would be sheer, but was pleasantly surprised! Love the color should had came for two windows They’re so beautiful! I’ve always loved Paisleys and the color is bright. Wish I, could of purchased 2 but they only had one available.  Love these curtains. A little expensive, but worth it. They are beautifully made out of satin. Match mr bed set perfectly. They come in many designs and colors. Only wish they had grommets instead of rod pocket. Low quality print. Detail non existent. Barely looks like same picture.  Almost sent back. Way overpriced for what you get. This review is for the waterfall picture. Love these! They are very strong and beautiful not good sewing as 2 sides put together doesn\\'t look good as it is kind of miss lines Well it flipped the picture but anyhow...my son has a plants vs zombies thing going so I thought these would go perfect and cheaper than the boring green curtains we looked at. I did have to flip the tops over and pin them because theyre so long but I think it worked! He loves it! Blurry print not like the image They are green at the top where they printed out. Want to make a window stand out Ambesonne is for you...keep coming back..highly recommend This was just what I needed in my home gym to give the room personality. I love the colors! Great!!! I ordered 7 different types of curtains before I came across these ones. They are absolutely perfect for what I wanted. The material is shiny feeling. I just wanted something with a tropical vibe. Nothing I got fit til these came in..our walls are light green and are cou ches are pale yellow. I have some tropical print throw 0illows from Lowes that tie in perfectly. And I only needed one set of curtains for my window, not 3 or 4 like others. Stunning in person. These curtains are light filtering, yet provide much needed privacy in our home. Adding a unique feature to the room, it doesn\\'t overpower the walls or furniture and blends in very well. I use these awesome land scape curtains as a replacement for bedroom closet doors... Great purchase!! Shared link with my family &amp; Friends!! Bad fabric Theu look great Love love my ocean view curtains.  Very vibrant colors and the price was reasonable.  They give us good vibes  They are the focak point of our living room.  As the light changes through the day, so does the view.  Everyone that sees them loves them. We received 2 of the same side panels when  we put them up the handle didn’t match up . Very disappointed I was dissapointed in these drapes because the coloring was very different.  One side was very light, and the other was very dark.  I will ask the company to send another set that match. Cheap material and amateurish printing. They are semi sheer and the already poor printing job is completely washed out by the sun, making it look like a motel bed sheet.<br>Overall, you could do better than this with a rag-in-a-bag from $ General for 1/4 what these cost.<br>Humorously enough, the plastic bag these ship in is twice as thick..... And probably cost more to make. I love ir Great curtains but the picture is not nearly as nice as expected. Bold and bright. The material is a little shiny and the hem buckles a little because of the thin quality of the material. They look nice, but I was expecting a little higher quality material. Nice curtains with vibrant colors! Using for area separation in my art studio. Looks great. Colors are good, but are cheaply made These curtains are really nice they added a pop of needed color Excellent product Nothing So, I took a chance on these curtains, because they were priced much better than others I\\'ve seen on Amazon. I was in the market for blackout curtains for my kid\\'s playroom, but I couldn\\'t find anything with a colorful, fun print in my price range. I searched and searched, and came across these, but they weren\\'t labeled blackouts. I thought I was going to have to compromise, and get something textured but on the boring side, but then I came across some nice,  inexpensive, textured, blackout curtains, that were beautiful, but boring, especially for a playroom.  Then I decided to take a chance on these,  and just double the curtains up. I liked the boring textured ones enough, that if I wasn\\'t happy with how these looked, I would just return them, and at least still have blackout curtains. I\\'m so glad I took a chance! I LOVE THEM! They fit my more mature midcentury modern decor, but are still fun and colorful enough for a playroom. The print is great, fun, nice, crisp and clear. The way the description said the background was gray, but at the end said light blue, so I wasn\\'t sure what to think. If you\\'re concerned about the background color, I would describe it as a light blue gray. Depending on the color on your walls will determine what you will perceive the color to be. My walls are light gray, so you pick up on the blue tint, but also can perceive it as a darker gray than the walls. Either way, if the curtains were a noticeable baby blue, or something similar, I don\\'t think I would have liked the curtains near as much, but where it stands, I like the color just fine. If I had to make a criticism, I would have loved if these were textured, and had like...a linen gray background, and were blackout curtains, but I know at their price point, that\\'s asking for way too much. So where it stands, I got this nice print, and a nice set of blackout curtains for the price of one set of decent blackouts. VERY HAPPY with my purchase!  For anyone who wants to know, these would be light filtering curtains, by themselves, but definitely not blackouts. Very pretty but cheap material. Nice addition to our living room though. Simplemente perfecta These curtains are exactly as described. They are made of quality material. The colors are vivid and the picture really pops.  I recommend this company. My son absolutely loved these curtains, they look exactly like the picture and the material is nice heavy durable and really soft. Keeps the sunlight out of his room when he\\'s trying to sleep and keeps the sun from waking him up in the morning too early. Highly recommend. short hem end where would normally put rod through was sewn on one end in 2 places with side piece.  Had to sew rod pocket on long hem side, also, too bright &amp; shiny. will return if they will allow. I bought it to decorate the wall, but found that the size is wrong, but the quality is OK Love these curtains! Very colorful.  Just wish they had a thicker backing to keep the light out. Good quality product.  Thank you very much. This is perfect. Love it Great❤️❤️ We would love to go back to Venice, but in the meantime will enjoy our curtains. We can\\'t get to Italy this year so at least we can have a beautiful view of the Amalfi Coast. Adds a bit of pizazz to our patio door! We wanted something rustic and barn look, we love these! I wanted sonething different and I\\'m glad to have it! Only shipped 1 of the curtains so only 1/2 of the scene The material is a little too thin for bedrooms or living rooms but works nicely in a den or computer room. Poor quality and wrong item These curtains look nothing like the picture  i am sending them back No where near as vibrant color. In fact, it looks like a giant bad resolution photo printed on fabric. Beautiful curtains!  Put up outside on Pergola swing for privacy and shade. We love it We love it Adorable curtains but they let a lot of light in Love Theses drapes. I got shorter black drapes to border the ends to extend the length.  They are a definite convo starter. It was just as expected beautiful and think enough with vibrant Christmas colors. I can\\'t wait to put them up again this Christmas. Bought it for the pattern and wanted to let the morning light in. It’s perfect. Perfect print, thick, great quality I love these curtains. It goes perfect with my living room. The pictures do not reflect what the product actually looks like in person. Great unusual curtain!  I love it! Perfect for our den. Brings the outside inside. Ties our colors and room theme together. Love the curtains But it came with 2 right side panels So it looks nothing like the picture please me what to do ?. Looks very cheap, don’t buy it I\\'m disappointed with these. The colors are pretty but the scene is blurry. Upon hanging them up found allot of thread runs in the fabric. So they look aweful when they are hung up. I contacted the company and have never heard back from them Great product, arrived on time and was exactly what we where expecting they look so pretty on my windows, I love them, they are worth the money. I got my order really fast  I like the quality of the curtain.  I made my Grandson room into Dragon theme I just love these drapes. I cant wait until the holidays to put them up. Superb quality..well beyond my expectations.I will definitely be buying a lot more from this company. Thankyou! Exactly what I wanted I was going to use these to cover up a doorless closet but they were too nice so I used them in my bedroom windows.  My new beach themed bedroom looks great!!! This works great to cover the back patio doors. I have too much crap back there anyway. I had a brain fart and put it up with Africa/Eurasia on the left. Nice thick material seems good quality. Replaced vertical blinds with Ambesonne curtain and it made a more welcoming room.  No privacy issues, fully blocks window.  Is not room darkening, soft light does filter through which was perfect for the application. Bella  Lindas y duraderas  Prefect for my studio Good fabric quality It says Blackout curtain, but isn’t close to it.  It doesn’t mitigate the sun coming in, but doesn’t repel the heat. A lot of light still comes through, especially through the lighter colors of the mountains and sky.  Even so, it is beautiful printing. Very happy with my curtains, they are so beautiful and unique! Good quality fabric, just the right weight. Only thing is ... the colors are not quite as vibrant as is pictured, but still very pretty. I love these curtains. They add warmth to my home. Perfect for summer. The first 3 photos are the curtains during the day. The last photo is the curtains at night. Awesome quality. It really enhances the decor of my Living room. I love how the natural light shines through the curtains giving an actual forest like feel. This is the best photo that creates a real image of nature. Breath taking. This looks so cheap and cheesy in person. I loved the design idea for my children’s’ playroom. But in person, the fabric is so shiny and poorly made. This on my  sliding glass doors in my living room.  We love it. I bought the cat bookshelf curtains to go on the sAme wallin my dining room.  Both are on sliding doors going out to our screened in porch. This  went into  my dining room..  I  really love it I feel like I’m at the beach AWESOME !!!! I am soooo happy with these tiger curtains....there more then I expected....has a white liner to protect from heat or cold...curtain itself is nice durable rugged material that will last...I am very pleased with all this !!!!! The tigers are girgeous but not overwhelming. And size is EXACTLY as orderd....\\'exactly\\' !!! Others had deceiveing sizes....these were perfect...a perfect fit !!! Highly recommended !! I gotwudth and length as orderd and needed in EACH panal. I just love these curtains !!!!! Will be used for a Mad Hatter Wedding theme - will likely be used for many parties thereafer! Lovely Very pretty but fairly thin, cheap material.  Like two very cheap curtains sewed together. Brightened up my classroom!!! Absolutely beautiful!! I use them as a backdrop to cover a hutch buffet while having online meetings. I receive so many compliments. THESE DRAPES ARE BEAUTIFUL, THEY HANG PERFECT AND THEY DO KEEP THE COOL AIR IN THE ROOM JUST WAITING TO SEE HOW WELL THEY ARE ABOUT KEEPING THE WINTER OUTDOORS INSTEAD OF LETTING IT IN. Very very very light, in every way There are horizontal lines running through the fabric on one of the panels and I am having trouble getting Ambesonne to answer me on how they will replace it. nan love it Perfect curtains for the garage windows. Was happy with the way it looked and felt I use the as a backing to Dept 56 dispay and the work great. Nice heavy fabic, this is my third scene that Ive bought. I can\\'t say enough of how I love these curtains. They brighten up my kitchen, and in the winter, it feels like it\\'s summer. I can sit and just stare at it and it feels like I\\'m there at that scene. &nbsp;Bought for my room so I could have something to look at. Very pretty, but I didn’t measure well XD In my patio i put it on each side looks nice and tropical. And you cant see through. Looks nice!! Great for babies nursery.  Beautiful curtains. These are very nice curtains, they do their job by keeping out reflective light, and at the same time not making it too dark for the room.<br><br>They also look very nice and complimented by everyone who sees them!<br><br>Very easy to install, we bought a white rod, and it matches really well with the ceiling! The image was as expected. I didn\\'t notice the fabric was polyester when I ordered them. I would prefer cotton fabrics. Undecided if I\\'ll keep them. ¹ a new office and music space. Was looking for something vibrant and colorful.  These are taller than I expected, but no complaints. I love everything about this I bought it twice Argued about delivery. Then this shows up over 2 weeks late.  Not what expected sorry. Quality print. Satin as advertised. Thankfully not 100% blackout. My bedroom window gets direct sunlight in the morning so the blinds need to be closed for these to effectively filter light for sleeping in. I\\'d guess with anything but an eastern exposure the curtains alone would suffice. Thank you so much well received and I really appreciate the picture of delivery thanks a million The coloring was beautiful - very happy with this purchase! These are good quality curtains. They are NOT sheer or see through. They are not black outs. They let in a soft glow of light. They are not thermal. A quality general purpose curtain for any room.  I put them over my sliding glass door. I wanted a diffused light that would provide privacy. These fit the bill perfectly.<br />I also tailored these to fit my odd size opening and they were a dream to sew.( I purchased larger than I needed in order to tailor without losing design )<br /> I was able to hem 3 1/4 inch at top. 4 inch at bottom (room for more) and there is room on 1 side only of EACH panel for tailoring without losing important elements of the design. Awesome Beautiful! Sturdy. Summer was the wrong time to buy them cause they keep in the heat in my room and cool in the adjacent room. I use them as a room divider. They do what their meant to do :-) Can\\'t wait to see their performance in the fall/winter. Expensive but very pretty. Like a large painting. Looks great! My daughter loves them I use these curtains as a background for my live streams because they have an acoustic guitar on them. They work great! They cover the entire area, they look really good, they\\'re washable and they are a great value for the money. I highly recommend them to everyone! Good quality one sided curtains, but colors are more washed out and not as sharp and vivid as expected So cool i like to much because this print so natural , I love the curtains!<br />Beautiful thick and worth the money spent. As expected I like the design every much. Fun mid mod touch! Great fabric! Make sure to look at the length! Thought I was ordering 84” and got 64” instead. Light shines right through. Very thin not worth the price. I love these curtains. I use them to cover a wide storage closet in my mud room. It adds beauty to a otherwise utilitarian room. These are gorgeous curtains. When the lights are off the moonlight actually shines through the moon so beautiful. This is my second time buying these kind of curtains, and I love how they accent a room. I absolutely love these curtains so much.  Not only are they just fun to look at, but they allow just enough light in, yet are not see through at all.<br /><br />The extra fun part is while the main side with the graphic is the inside focus, from the outside of the window, it is still fairly visible and is just a fun aesthetic. They are beautiful!!! The colors don\\'t look like the advertisement. Too much color orange washed over both panels. Not quality material We love it! Very good quality material and workmanship. Only draw back is that it lets more light through than we thought so the picture appears lighter but overall it\\'s awesome. Vivid image. Let\\'s some light through, but not sheer. Love them. Definitely not blackout curtains.  The picture is good, but when the sun comes though it looks a little faded.  Overall, I like them.  They are very big though, not for a regular sized window these are more appropriate for a sliding glass door. I absolutely love theses curtains worth every penny vibrant perfect with my Asian decor the colors in them are a perfect match.<br>Very, very satisfied Pockets were of unequal sizes by at least 3/8 inch, ~10mm, which is noticeable at the pockets and especially the design.  See attached pictures<br />Shoddy workmanship and quality control. I LOVE these curtains. Everyone that sees them want to know where i got them. They to LOVE them. Very unique. Made with VERY Good MATERIAL,<br>Would RECOMMEND !!! Absolutely beautiful. Better than I thought they would be. I removed my laundry room doors and hung a tension rod behind the door frame. I put up these curtains instead. Much more room in a small multi-use space. I’m very happy with the design- it lines up very very well. It will look nicer after I steam it but it is too hot right now. I wanted a mural to give the room some personality but calming because the world is stressful right now. The curtains block more sound than I was expecting and would block 80 to 90 percent of light if they were in front of a window. Goes well with stainless steel furniture and all the mammals in my house seem to find it soothing. I would definitely buy curtains from this company again. Beautiful but way to light. That almost looks like a cheap knockoff version of the picture that\\'s displayed. But again it is still very beautiful I just don\\'t know if I would pay $69 for it again This has become my favorite curtain set! It’s perfect for my western theme and I like that the photo is vivid but muted. I get many compliments asking where I purchased them! Gave as gift Loved these curtains for my sons room. Sadly he didnt agree. But the quality and designs are amazing! My son just loves them Look nothing like picture. So disappointed ☹️ It really blocks out the light would have liked if it was a little more transparent but satisfied with my purchase over all I feel like I’m staring at a forest!! I haven\\'t hung yet but will submit a picture when I do.  Color is not very crisp...kind of like a fuzzy picture.  Hoping up on wall it will look better than out of package. During the pandemic and staying home I needed a visual view of a happy place.  This was perfect!!! Love these curtains. We used them for our sons closet when we redid his room from Spider-Man to his teen football room. They are perfect  I liked that it came in Time for Memorial Day and 4th of July. So I got to show my patriotism. Not pretty hanging. I really like them but one panel in each one is off by almost two inches on one and about three inches on the other one.  I have rearranged furniture to not see the panel size difference. We thought these were blackout curtains. But they are not. They are really cool looking though. A bit overpriced tho. We decided to keep them for our son. But had to get cheap blackout blinds to keep it dark for him the way he likes it. quick easy return and refund...just didn\\'t fit on our window wall as we thought it might...excellent overall quality of fabric --loved it, just didn\\'t fit. Very pretty. I waited four months to receive this (first vendor thru Walmart never shipped it and this vendor was slow to ship). I tossed it in the wash on a very gentle cycle, just took it out and some seams are undone! I’m going to sew up the seam rather than send it back but, grrrrrrr. Finally found my curtains and they are everything I wanted I love them These look awesome !  One side was slightly longer than the other, but overall great quality and exactly what my son wanted !!<br />We added some blackout curtains behind them because they are very see through. Wow!  So beautiful:  the fabric is thicker than I expected.  Using it between two rooms (so ignore the buildout mess).  Could not wait to hang it.  Simply stunning!  Worth the wait! Córners are not even ! One side is longer that the other ! But after all my husband like it ! The material is awesome! I love the colors. It\\'s a perfect fit with my tropical living room scheme. These curtains are thick and the material looks and feels nice. However, they aren’t as detailed as they look in the pictures. They’re quite short so look out of place. Quality product.  Very nice material.  Good thickness.<br>Great color and lines.<br>Only drawback was it took 4 weeks for delivery. Love these! Look amazing! The product said set of 2 curtains, I received 2 different curtains. So they are useless since I’m not using two different scenes on one window. This is the second curtain I have purchased from this company.  The first one was not 84 inches long either, but is not as bad as this one.  At this curtains longest point it is 82 inches.  The length varies visibly.  They will need to be cut off and hemmed shorter to look reasonably good.  The side hems are not the same width, which shows with the light coming through them. Beautiful curtains  we are doing a home gym and these curtains are perfect for the theme. When ordering I thought they were a 63” and a 84” coke to find out they are 108 in length which is longer than I need. However I will fix them I love these curtains for my home gym.<br>The most beautiful part about these curtains is the Big Bold Beautiful Writing. The colors are very very nice and bright. I purchased the black and orange and they look fabulous they look much better in person. They come pack really nice need no ironing. And they are washable. The material is great quality no complaints from me.  I am just going to hem mine just a bit. I love my new gym curtains. I would recommend these curtains especially if your during a gym theme for your home during this Quarantine. I may post another picture once everything in the gym is complete. It was also fast shipping two days. A satisfied customer. Overall, I like it where it is. A work of art that fit my style. I really liked the curtains. and nobody else had it. it\\'s pretty decent quality and looks good. At least good value for 25$. Adds a Great look to bedroom These are very heavy lined and they keep most of the sunlight out. They\\'re very pretty and they look really nice on the wall I waited months past the estimated date for these panels. I ordered two packages of the same dimensions (total four panel). One order was two inches shorter than the other. I had already waited so long, I just kept them.<br />They are not attractive and very poor quality. I will never order from this company again. The scene is beautiful the weight of the fabric is heavy enough but not too heavy. The fabric is also thick not thin at all. I used it to cover the front of some old book cases. Can’t wait to put on the windows in my living room, my windows were separated, but still looks good! Keeps the heat outside and cool air inside. Especially here in Arizona with the heat of 112 degrees to the last 10 days. I love these curtains so much.<br /><br />The Ambesonne Beach Curtains, Palm Leaves in Catalina Island Dominic are beautiful. I feel like I am at the beach 24 hours a day. They are NOT blackout curtains which allows the sun to shine through the curtains and you are able to see  through the  back ground. My only issues is I wish I had  ordered  the  108 x 96 instead of 108 x 84.<br /><br />It is well with the money. The map image is cool, but the sun shines right through and there\\'s no thermal insulation to the curtain.  I was hoping for a thicker, more heat/cold efficient design, but the material is one-layer of medium thick material, so no thermal insulation.  On top of that the sun comes right through so there\\'s not a lot of light protection.  Pretty expensive for a mediocre product. I love it and used it for my living room curt Than You. Great view inside the home, thanks to Covid. Welp- this is the next best thing.<br>Kinda sheer let’s light and sound in, but really beautiful like a back ground for photo day. They are beautiful, just amazing These curtains has made a great statement...love them...highly recommend Beautiful! Love them. Wow. Perfect. Beautiful. Everything I could ever ask for. Took a picture of them up and sent out to all my friends. Got rave reviews. Perfect for my Little Mermaid theme! I\\'m using this as a room divider and it looks great.  It\\'s hangs nicely, it\\'s weighty and adds a nice element of design.  It goes well with farmhouse, urban and many other types of decor.  I also love the option to order various lengths--this is key to making it work as a room divider!  Thanks for the great product! I absolutely LOVE these curtains!! I get so many compliments on them. I’m so happy with this product. My brother is bed ridden so this makes him smile with joy to look at. These are very cool!  Looks awesome We love, love, love  BEAUTIFUL, I ORDERED ANOTHER, SMOOTH, SILK-ISH, NOT TO HEAVY.<br />ARRIVE FAST. I\\'M HAPPY. Nothing but love, love love for these curtains. They are perfect! Opaque enough to provide maximum privacy but allow some sun light in until you\\'re ready to draw them back to let the sun in. Great product. I didn’t like this item it’s to short in length Perfect for my enclosed porch. Can\\'t see in but they let light in to brighten up the room. Love them! Nice looking on a window.<br>It changes the feel. This wall curtain is fkn awesome. It\\'s got excellent color and detail.  I covers up my bedroom entrance.  You can\\'t even tell it\\'s behind the curtain. I took a pic from inside my room looking out.  You can do photoshoots with this .  I need to hook a blacklight up now. Going to put these up today. They are a bit shiny as other types of these image drapes are. However, they are very pretty. I got an image of a window with a beach background. My window in my bedroom is huge and the room is small. I am hanging them from the ceiling to help keep the room feeling open. These are not sheer but light does come through so not a blackout drape. Too big and long. Great if ur a giant. Sun comes thru easy so during the daytime you can\\'t even see the pattern on the front. I wouldn\\'t buy these I wasted my money Greeat colors, size, feels great !!! Will order again. Just like pictures shown. Used this for a door way and works great. There is a left and a right curtain in each order. I ordered 108 x 84 Fern Green for my office. The product looks EXACTLY like the picture on cite with great  quality. The fabric is heavy/silky which allows the curtains to display the print well without seams. These curtains are absolute garbage. Whatever material they are printed on is awful. There are also threads hanging off everywhere, they\\'re all slightly different sizes... just complete and total garbage. For $75 - do not buy these. That is a crazy amount of money to spend on these. The most I would spend realistically is $10. That is how awful they are.<br />There is also bleeding in the printing. And there are UPCs printed directly on the back of the curtains, right near the edge, so depending on how the curtains hang, you can see them. UPCs. Directly printed on them. What the heck.<br />That said, the pattern IS nice and the colors are night and bright.... but I would only use these in say a dorm room. Somewhere that beer is going to be sprayed everywhere and you need a pretty plastic tarp to protect the walls. ... not good. Very very very disappointed. Cheap and thin material without backing contrary to some reviews from a while back. So thin it shows the window crossbars ruining the picture effect. Picture is also hazy/blurry. Not cut straight so won\\'t stay closed in center, also making the dual panel picture effect useless. Waste of money. Just perfect for entry way. Will be getting doors eventually but this is such a great and inexpensive way for right now They use the same image on the curtain, no matter what the ratio of length to width is. They just stretch to picture to fit the size of the cloth. Mostly that\\'s not a big deal. I mean, having wider buildings isn\\'t that big a deal, but it\\'s really obvious that the moon is not a circle.  They\\'re going in my kids\\' room, and they don\\'t care, but it bugs me every time I see it.<br /><br />The material itself is nice and blocks light well. These are pretty shiny. I bought 4 panals with the idea of usung them for different projects but the fabric is not the best. I am keeping one set and returning the other set. There are options for reducing the sheen that I am going to try. The fabric will not have a light, airy feel as they are thick. Loves the woodsy feel and color of these curtains.  They are a real departure from the usual neutrals, but I like the change.  Fabric is soft, but silky/shiny.  They are not black out but do filter alot of light. JUST WHAT EVERY LITTLE RACE FAN WANTS Not worth the buy This is perfect what I was looking for a size it’s perfect I’m happy . These curtains are a little bit dull compared to the stock photo. They also had a stain on the back. I decided to keep them since they were on backorder for a month for a replacement. this item nice had to get sowed together came size if the wall.. doesnt keep light out but its cute in my son\\'s room I originally bought these for our bedroom as a cool background for our bed. However, the right curtain cityscape would have been hidden by the bed. We kept them and just redid our living room - paint, take up the carpet, etc. and put them behind the French doors to the sunroom so it looks like an actual view to NYC.<br><br>We\\'re going to get another set with a different view to switch them out. I love this.  I have to get a larger rod to hang them.  Really neat!  Thanks!  Teri These are very nice well made curtains. The fabric is silky and a little heavy. I love them! They work really good for my patio doors in the kitchen and the sunflowers go great with my country kitchen theme. The picture did not line up with adjacent panel. Stitching was crooked and fold in material as well so does night align So adorable!!! They are silky and don’t wrinkle easily and they fit perfectly in my daughter’s new cat bedroom!  Used it as a back drop for a play. It worked wonders. Very pretty sunset without being overpowering. Silky feel fabric. Hangs well.  Not see through but lets some light through it took along time to come in and it is very colorful but it had stains at the bottom.  seller does not get back to me, i have sent pictures .  not happy with sellers lack of customer service looks great in my office. Good quality Cheap material and looks it when hung.<br />Would not have purchased if I had a “do over” Love it The curtain has brilliant colors,  it lets the light in but you can\\'t see in from outside,  even at night.  I couldn\\'t get them in 54\" long so I had to cut and hem before I could use them.  Which was a lot because I had 2 set to cover the windows.  I won\\'t do that again.  All on all they make the room look good and my son is happy.  It took a long time for them to arrive. I received my window treatment unexpectedly today when initially I was told it takes up to 3 weeks post purchase. I am so impressed! I love the color and graphic design of the curtains and they fit in perfectly to my oriental living room design. Thank you so much for existing as a company, I will be back for more in the future. I am definitely not happy with my purchase. The curtains DO NOT LOOK LIKE the picture online. They should show how the curtains look on actual windows with REAL light coming in. When I put the curtains up with the natural light shinning through the curtains were too light like almost see through. It just doesn\\'t look good in my opinion AT ALL! I wish the curtains had a black backing on it. They didn\\'t feel like they were worth what I paid for- almost 70 dollar curtains and this is what I got? They felt cheap and thin. Not sure how they would hold up in the washer? I am just not pleased with these curtains AT ALL. Extremely disappointed and returned them already  This is most I ever spent on curtains but it is very pretty. If the price was right, I would make another purchase but on examining how the curtain is made, I can buy some fabrics/materials and make my own less than 1/3 of the price. The printing is beautiful, the construction is great.  The size is exactly what I ordered.  They arrived quickly.  These curtains look awesome when the sun is shining from behind.  They made a huge difference in my cooling bill over the summer.  I\\'m super happy with this purchase. Beautiful colors that give your room a warm glow with the light enhancing the bright colors during the daylight. At night the darkness deepens the watercolors of the curtains for a variety of appearances from the same set of curtains. printed photo looks great. thickness of curtains was good, but I was looking for more of a black out curtain effect so I just bought another set of white black out curtains and placed on a separate pole behind these on wall.  I got these curtains at during the early part of pandemic so they arrived a little late but look amazing,  having this \"ocean view\" added to the home helped brighten and cheer up the mood while everyone had to stay indoors for quarantine.<br />I would recommend this product. Looks amazing, hella expensive but I love it. Ok, not the most important, but was surprised it took 5 days when I was expecting 5 weeks! It\\'s exactly what I was looking for. Scenic, good fabric. Only issue is minor one. From looking at photo in description, was expecting better detail. But for the price, I\\'m happy with it.<br><br>If Amazon is monitoring this, the package has arrived! I really love these curtains. They seem to be well made. Only problem is the design looks purplish instead of dark brown especially when back lighted by the sun. Not sheer. Think they give privacy but haven\\'t tested this at night yet. Love the barn door image! es realmente hermosa Very thin,image was messed up as it didn\\'t match up with the two so looks weird.couldnt put them together right or it looked off. Absolutely beautiful in my apartment! I love them!!!!  Great detail, rich colors. Very opaque, like a blackout curtain. Perfect for hiding the messy look of my homemade clothes hanging closet in my bedroom—makes the wardrobe end of the room look like a forest. Very peaceful and relaxing compliment to the room. Would buy again. Beautiful.Go for it.You will love them. So I thought the orchids were on the opposite side  This curtain adds a tropical, lovely look to the house. It really adds interest and has the hand painted look. They are so beautiful! Love the sunflower pattern on these when the sunlight hits just the right amount rod light comes in. Was originally<br>considering  darkening curtains as I was nervous about how see through they would be but I didn’t need them at all! I have this Ambessone European print pair of curtain panels in 120” length.  I use it as a floor to ceiling room divider between my bed and my office space.<br /><br />It is not completely black out, but its opaque enough that no one can see through either side even at night with a light on.  That it’s not full blackout is fine for me. I love how my color changing LED bulb in my office plays against the charming illustration of this Italian scene.  It turns it into a gently glowing tapestry next to my bed with my set up.<br /><br />It is double layered white material that’s a little satin in shine.  The ink is smooth and I textured against the fabric.<br />I am annoyed by this barcode printed right on the back edge of the panel you’ll see in my attached photo.  It makes the curtain look cheaper.<br /><br />I washed it when I got it—did fine in my Washing machines and dryer.  I did not use bleach. It is just not as vibrant as the picture. It is just not a vibrant as the picture, and not very long.  It also says it is a sound proof Curtain. It is not very thick. It\\'s so colorful and bright! Thin material more for looks than temperature retention. I purchased for privacy and I absolutely love how it looks. The pattern lines up to match while hanging. They were great for what we used them for. Just as described, excellent quality The curtains are beautiful. Fabric is very poor quality.  Too thick and doesn\\'t drape well, looks like it will pull easily, and print doesn\\'t look the same in person as it appears online. I didn\\'t like it at all. Good material and gorgeous colors! Was in excellent condition no dislikes These are exactly what I wanted to dress up my bedroom. I will definitely order a set for the living room as well. I like everything about it Perfect fit for the window. Blocks light when totally pulled together. Compliments from several people about the unique picture they give. I received two curtains that did not match in the middle to make the mandala.  Both sets I ordered did not have the matching curtain to finish the mandala. love these curtains for the sliding doors to my back deck. True to pictures. Look great! Nice extra layer of darkness These are perfect for my guitar lounge. Actually nice quality for the price. They look awesome and black out the morning sun for recording under controls light. i really do like these there so nice to look at in your front or back room thank you This the most wonderful addition to my living room!!  They are beautiful, have an orange leather sofa and my big wall painted sunset, so theses curtain look wonderful heavy enough for wall, sheer and silky feel. Love them great buy you will not be disappointed in these!! Gave it as a gift. Very happy with it. I put these curtains up to hide the storage part of my covered patio. It looks great! I luved this product,  luved the fall , cozy feeling  1st pic vertical blinds open completely with sun , 2nd pic is at night !! And i have curtain lights bhind !! The pattern did not line up. This is very beautiful, very well made. I am very pleased! And it arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected! These curtains are so awesome. I live in an apartment and the size curtain I bought is long for my door. I wish it didn\\'t have the beige border on it. That would make these curtains perfect. Even so, I love them. They are thick and real good quality. The back is white. In the day you can not see the barn door from outside. At night when the lights are on inside you see the barn door from the outside and it is so beautiful! One of my favorite purchases! This is the second set albeit different image i\\'ve purchased.  They look extraordinary with the sun behind them.  They\\'re very well built, heavy enough to insulate and due to the material they almost seem to glow with the sunlight.  Arrived timely and as advertised, doesn\\'t get better than that. I thought the neutral colors and mandala pattern would be perfect I’m my bedroom. I patiently awaited the arrival, gleefully hung it up, and stepped back to admire... what looks like a pattern of a hairy b-hole. The way the pattern is cut where the curtains open is just kind of, inappropriate. Folks- this is the difference between a photo and the real thing sometimes. So I’m dying of laughter as I take down my b-hole curtain. Not the sellers fault, it was a nice thick material, but maybe not the best color/pattern combo. While they are pretty, I was expecting them to be red. I placed these curtains in front of an unfinished wall in a new barn studio apartment. You\\'re in a barn with a penthouse view! So cool! Poorly packaged. Impossible to remove the deep wrinkles.  Tried steaming, washing, ironing to no avail.  Can not hang these curtains in this condition.  DO NOT PURCHASE. I love the look.  Idk why there is any reviews but when I bought them months ago they\\'re were reviews.  People said it had a reddish look which i dont c much of that. Ive got compliments numerous times on them.  They aren\\'t black out but buy a curtain holders that holds 2 curtain rods. I bought black, blackout curtains for the inside.  The blackout curtains hold coolness and repel heat and also keep heat in.  I can verify that it keeps it cooler.  I havent gone thru winter yet but I\\'m sure they will help cuz my window always let in alot of cool air.  They kinda pop when sun hits these curtains. They really give you a rusgic look which ive been going for. These curtains are well made. Very durable. We love them We just remodeled our kitchen and dining area. Our neighbors thought it was a creative idea versus having plain curtains. I wanted it to feel like we were in a Tuscan village while in coronavirus quarantine! This is also a great backdrop for ZOOM meetings!! Highly recommend, good quality material! Pedi devolución pero esto ya lo recibi .. Gracias !!! This is in my bedroom. It adds joy and color. So glad I took the leap of faith and bought it. The fabric is thick and lush. It filters the light beautifully. Absolutely beautiful.  I love them so much.  Not sheer.  Can not see through.  Just beautiful. They look great The hem on the pocket rod is completely off- which is all I see now. The seller never replied to my email to discuss how to handle this. It took a month for them to arrive. Shall I wait another month for a replacement? I think not. I’m NOT happy I was looking for a way to decorate the BLACK back wall of the toy hauler (the ramp) when using the RV garage as a guest bedroom/man cave. Used a tension rod and this and it looks great! Quality material, vibrant colors and price was very reasonable for this size and quality. Over all great product. Liked everything about these curtains,thanks so much!! I love these curtains I have no complaints it works perfectly I couldn’t be more satisfied with the quality! Absolutely beautiful and VERY well made. Don’t hesitate! they turn out lighter than the picture but they are lovely. Product looks like the picture, very cute. It is sheer from the blank side but not worried. As far as keeping warmth in the house in front of the windows I have not been able to test yet. Does provide good shade. I think they look cheap Wonderful to look at. Great color. Thick to keep cold air and hot sun out. Curtains do not look like picture Beautiful quality image. Arrived 4 weeks earlier than expected. Perfect ,great quality absolutely love them This curtain is absolutely stunning! it is very life like and I genuinely connects with these two horses. It is certainly not plain. I also love the quality. It looks like a giant high quality picture frame in my living room on my yellow walls. It breathes happiness when the sun shines through them. I will always love that I invested on these curtains. The price is great fora high quality gal on a budget! I will be buying for fall and X-Mas.  Do it, you wont regret it. Very satisfied I used them for my back room (back door) to the deck/dock. When they\\'re shut reminds us of Sunrise homestay in Fiji. When we were there last year.. I am happy with them..and yes they\\'re blackout curtains..we live in Florida so even today was hot /humid from the hurricane in the gulf of Mexico..so it kept the sun out and the room was noticibly more comfortable with them than without. Not good at all After a long months of searching for the right solutions to what to do with my bedroom wall, I have decided to take a chance this product. If I dont like it I\\'ll just return it. To my surprise, it came earlier than what Amazon estimated time.  Very beautiful The curtains are beautiful and I would have Kept them, but one panel was longer than the other. Another problem I had was trying to get a label to send them back.  You have to have a printer to print your own label and I just have a chrome book.  I had to have some one get into my account to print a label for me.  I was going to get one for each season, but I can\\'t now because of the label return policy.  I told them my problem but they would not make me a label to return them. So they will have to be returned when my friend gets a label for me. I do love the first set I got from them. They were sewn correctly. Love the product. And great price. This curtain is absolutely beautiful. Love the colors and design. A bit long, but that\\'s okay. Wrinkles fell out after about 24 hours and it looks beautiful. Win win . Be a flamingo In a flock of pigeons. These curtains were excellent addition. They keep the chill out but let in just the right amount of light when closed. They look great when they are opened.<br>A lot of people have complimented on them. Beautiful!!!!! Good quality Love the colors The right-half of the curtain has a crooked stitching so the picture doesn’t line up.<br>The crookedness can be seen towards the bottom of the curtain. I needed a room divider for my spare bedroom. I am a cat and tiger lover and when I saw this I just had to order it and I am so glad I did, Beautiful colors and well made. I recommend this item to anyone that is looking for a stunning and beautiful curtain. Great buy  Looks like a zoomed out heavily pixelated version of the picture not 3D ish at all They fit just right and they block out most of the light, and theyre nice and thick Love, love it Love, love it Loves these curtains.  Our home is decorated in a Tuscan theme and these go perfect.  Our patio door is ony 75 inches wide and I was worried about the 108 inches wide of the curtains.  But that is the perfect width.  The company has all different kinds of picture window curtains and shower curtains. Pretty but the colors are not that bright. Colors are way brighter in pic even with shade drawn in background these are thin sheer and light not at all as pic shows I love these curtains.  Very warm and vibrant colors. They add so much character to my living space. Great quality, brings warmth and make our home look like fall. The curtains are made a beautiful fabric and the pattern is awesome. They hang nicely. Great value These curtains are beautiful. The printing is quality (low blur). Colors are vivid. These are neither sheer nor blackout. Works great for my living room. Came quick, I love them, they are heavy and made excellent ! Thank you They are perfect in my apartment. I pull them closed and I look out at my dock on the lake. It’s like having a huge piece of wall art. Such a great deal on an awesome purchase!! I was pleasantly surprised at how these curtains looked and felt. Nice and thick and looked just like the photo shown on website. My son loves them. &nbsp;I love the fabric piece came in. They were a silky seen. Super lightweight so they were perfect drapes to cover an antiquated mirror closet. I recently redid my theater room. Geez really completed it! Looking at the website now to see what else I can get. D’s were different than anything I had seen while I was shopping for the theater room. I hope this helps someone make up their mind about the purchase. I love it! I didn\\'t realize there was a return window on these curtains and I missed my deadline.  The print looks very cheap in person and the curtains are very thin. Many compliments on the curtains.  Fits my theme very well. Granddaughters  bedroom  These curtains are  wonderful  Ordered the bedspread as well  Doing her room over for Christmas Misleading advertising. I have placed the order of the Tiger Curtains as shown, instead I have received the wrong itums \"curtains\" of 2 Pannels ( each pannel got 1/2 face on it.  the secound pannel will compleate Tigers face  added together!!! As you can see on the upload of the compleate curtain. NOT at all like the 2 whole Tigers seen walking side by side as advertised.  What I have seen on the advertising of the cortain was a beautiful pictures of 2 Tigers. I am so very disapointed and need to Return this itum. Please mail a return label. Further I\\'m Requesting my full refunds  tax included fee of 53.52 dollars - wasted. Shipped directly by amazon.  Thank you! Cumple con lo que buscaba I loved the color and design; fit perfectly with the theme I have going on; the only thing I didn\\'t like was that they could have been a little wider had to buy 2 sheer panels put on either ends to make up for spacing otherwise I love them Looked amazing! We live next to the forest (which is fenced off) and that is what I see when looking out back ... and these curtains on our large living room windows are so beautiful and blends in with our home.  I really loved it.  I add some curtain lights to add more drama... the quality is really good.  Highly recomended... I was very pleased with the quality of these curtains.  They look great and hang well. This is a heavy curtain with an extra backing to keep a lot of light out. I like that in the curtain. And I enjoy the picture! Fabric is heavy so it hangs nicely Super buenas y tremenda calidad Was skeptical but loved it once it was up, definitely worth the money in my opinion, gonna try another one out soon Fabric quality is nice and thick however the ornament pattern was not very bright and vibrant.  Little disappointing. Looks beautiful in my living room I love the image it’s very nice to look at. My only complaint is that it is not double sided, so the picture is only on one side. I feel for the amount this curtain cost , it should have two sides. Oh well Very nice Halloween curtains They were thick enough and looked perfect in my dining room the colors were beautiful set an I would recommend a bit pricey but it was nice I love these curtains I’m so pleased with them. I’m actually using them as shears with my old curtains to the side I think it looks beautiful These curtains were probably the only curtains that both my kids an I  could agree on. We hung it up on our deck and it looks like french doors opening up.. Curtain is good quality, much better than expected. It looks like there is a beach outside my window. Great feel good for these cold dreary days covered in snow and ice. I really like the curtain but I gave them 2 stars because I order 108”X84” but I received shorter than what I have bought. I emailed the seller but they insist that I have the right measurements. So, I took a picture to prove that I was telling the truth. Perfect color, material and softness Thickness was nice. If you sing as window treatment they are not shear. I utilized the curtains for a double closet.(Didn’t want to purchase nee closet doors) Wanted to have a relaxing room to go to and the curtains take me there ☺️ The curtains are beautiful. Hanging in wide doorway (old house) in one room to keep it warmer. This would be great as window curtains, not sheer, good fabric. Created a new home binder. Made diagrams of each rooms measurements. I looked for almost 4 months for the right curtains. So, glad I did. These are a perfect fit and they look amazing in our dining room. The fabric is shiny satiny material. It\\'s perfect. It looks like a photo in a magazine. STUNNING!! I love these curtains! They are beautiful and give my living room a beautiful look!! Great colors for decorating an interior window.  These hide the backs of bookshelves in our library.  The students really like them! Gorgeous baby Purchased for my sons forest themed room. They’re nice but one of the panel’s color is faded. Not sure they were quite worth all that money but had trouble finding something he liked.  We hemmed them to fit his window. Beautiful graphics! Such rich, vibrant colors.<br>Good value for the money. Very sheer image Is lightly printed. Worth about a third of the price. I absolutely love these for Christmas!! They are thick but yet not room darkening. I would definitely recommend. Great curtains!  They let just enough light through for a nice ambient glow. It looks better in the picture. It is a bit lighter than I expected. Great price for curtains. It\\'s only good for the night.bcz day time can\\'t see the picture..very thin can\\'t stop sun light. Simply beautiful Looking for a curtain to decorate for Christmas well guess what \"I found it\" These are justed as pictured.  Vibrant holiday colors.  Good quality.  Can\\'t wait to put them up.  The sizing is accurate.  I reccomend this product. I thought they were smaller and thought about returning it. But thank goodness I have not. They are beautiful and brighten up the entire room. Just what one needs to finish the decoration No se ven como en la foto el grafiti es bajo de color no son desagradables pero tampoco son como esperaba Ok-my boys thought these were the coolest things they’d ever seen...in the photo.  Upon arrival and installation, however, they are essentially shower curtains-super super sheer and print quality does NOT appear as represented on Amazon-fuzzy printing.  Yuck-just admire the fun photos of these and move on....sorry to disappoint. Cool idea POOR execution. I put these up and was a bit disconcerted that they were so dark. The black tree trunks so pronounced. I reversed them right for left and beheld a significant difference. couldn\\'t be more pleased when the sun is behind them. Added a blackout pair behind to block street lights and voila. I\\'m using it for a window facing out. The design also shows inside. Just what I\\'d hoped for. Will you have some with spring trees? They darken the room just perfectly. We loved it we’re using it in our office as a back drop... ❤️ more well made than we thought that they would be.  they are not sheer but we did not want sheer curtains. I love the design on these curtains. They totally make the mood for my classroom. I have received numerous compliments since putting them up.<br><br> They are opaque enough to provide shade, but translucent enough to let the light in. Totally worth the price. Entry of our house are double doors I wanted covered as we did not use them but used another entrance from hallway into that office. I bought this barn door curtain to cover the doors in the foyer and I absolutely LOVE it!!!  I was not certain at all that a curtain could truly pull off a \"barn door\" look, but omg it\\'s amazing!!!! The foyer seems so much larger and with a farmhouse design this is definitely a win!!!! Easy fixer upper without carpenters or dust!!!!! Love it lukon beautiful  Very Good product  I love it Unique and perfect for it\\'s use as the doorway to my home theater. I have received many complaints. Wish the curtains blocked light. Width of the curtains seems shorter than normal Better than expected. Very good quality! My son loves the design on these curtains, but they\\'re definitely not blackout. They\\'re thin and the light comes right through. Good purchase for the design though. Too sheer and the material feels like a shower curtain Beautiful , thick but not to thick ..... keeps my living room dark enough as advertised . I placed the sheer panels  between the two and to me it makes it original and more beautiful !!Gorgeous I got a Halloween and a xmas curtain at the same time So at $70 for the Xmas curtain  verses $95 for the Halloween curtain the Xmas curtain is junk and The Halloween curtain was fabulous ( longer. Thicker and a much better material not see thru ) ! You can see thru the Xmas  one  and it\"s thin material . so since it is so light  and didn\\'t hang right I had to add heavy fringe to extend the length and to get it to hang better. I wouldn\\'t buy from the Xmas curtain seller again.the scene is nice but the curtain is just so inferior - I would pay more if they made it better like the Halloween curtain I bought. I absolutely love these. They are thick enough to keep the streetlight out completely at night, but sheer enough that I wake up to see the sun light glowing through the curtains, highlighting the trees, and I feel like I’m a forest creature in the deep woods. It was about 2 ft longer than what I ordered Image is a little lighter in person, but well made. Silky feel but rough on the interior facing the glass. Excellent privacy and I like that this 2-piece replaced a 4-piece curtain. Better coverage and the subtle water-color bamboo image is the perfect contrast. Room is brighter. Very happy with the purchase. We just moved &amp; didn\\'t want the neighbors seeing all our business! It\\'s been a while since I shopped for curtains &amp; I forgot what a pain it was. Height, width, weight, sheerness, rod vs grommet vs pinch pleat. Once you figure all that out it\\'s time to look at colors. We really wanted grommet, but this is a sliding glass door &amp; the size we needed only came in a rod pocket. That was easily fixed with those little pinch hanger rings. Our living room is in all different colors &amp; we just love these curtains! The design is bright &amp; vivid on a white background. It\\'s a slick-feeling material that isn\\'t at all sheer, but lets some light come in. Standing on the porch with the curtains closed I can\\'t see into the room, which is what we wanted. The white background keeps the room nice &amp; bright. We\\'re very happy with our new curtains! Good material. Great colors. Nicer than I was expecting. Beautiful scenery. Love this curtain. It is not sheer it provides great coverage and looks beautiful. Colors are vibrant and when the sunshine’s behind it - gorgeous!!! Definitely worth the price. These curtains are really cute. My daughter\\'s loved them. Great quality. Picture print looks really clear. They are nice &amp; thick. You can\\'t see thru them. I was really impressed. Totally recommend. ordered it sent it back -ups- the product was beautiful,wife didn\\'t like ---refund staes sent 40 days later still no refund?STILL DIDNT GET MY REFUND- WHEES IT AT SOMEBODY SHOULD DO SOMETHING. PISSED!!! These curtains are amazing, very well made.  Great deal for the price. So pretty and looks great with my blue themed Christmas. Totally worth every penny!! These look awesome on my back sliding doors! Great fit. Good material.  Well made. Just look great! Was surprised! Perfect addition to the dining room for the holiday! I bought Ambesonne Landscape Curtains for zoom meetings. The two pieces didn\\'t match up to created the design it display on the picture. I am assuming it is a manufacture mistake. Therefore I can\\'t say not to buy them. one side of curtin was not sewn so I cant use and no one reply s or gives a refund Super long so o have to roll the bottom.<br>Looks like the door. Very nice I did not like how black in color this was.  I understand it was to look like the forest at night but I thought it was dark green it was very black in the areas that look dark green.  And the deer face looked more cartoon than real. Excellent print, brings an has an Asian theme into my room. The two sides of the curtain align very well. These are so beautiful and fun but I had to return due to not matching my decor. Nice curtains. Would be beautiful if they were hemmed right. I got in the mail exact same design.  Thats mest up. I love it ❤ it is as it apears.  so pretty on the sliding glass door. Put this in my sunroom everyone thinks it\\'s great, life size it looks like you could walk through it Very thick and we\\'ll made. Definitely holds heat and blocks light, though the moon kind of lights up with a light behind it, which is breathtaking. I would definitely recommend. We are using in our garage to hide away some boxes from view. Was impressed by the thick curtain with well-stitched lining. The design of the brown stone wall is all quite realistic at closeup. Couldn\\'t be happier. I enjoy most is the privacy provided by the curtains hanging in my living room. They also still allow the sunlight to illuminate the area GREAT PURCHASE  Great quality, was very happy of classy it made my living room look The curtains are good and kind of thick I used them as a brick wall on my mobile home and it added another different style to it. I really loved them and  I feel more like home... also I got good compliments from the family, they loved it also. This was awesome! Very bright and the contrast was spot on! I will be buy more of these. Had to iron them and they do not filter out light. Pretty to look at and very festive. The colors are very bright and nice it was the perfect size and it fits nicely up against my window Love it. I have a southwest theme in my living room and these are perfect and I just love them It even resists my kitten claws. Great for ambiance in my bedroom These curtains are thick, heavy and the images are excellent. They help keep the light out and is very festive. Definitely will be order another set. Absolutely beautiful the look on my daughters face was priceless The main color of these curtains is white, so they have a luminescence when there is a back light.  They are sturdy and have vivid colors that give the room a festive feel.  Great quality for the price! My husband and I are avid hunters and our home looks like you’re walking in the woods basically, so when I saw this current I thought PERFECT. When I opened the package I was pleased with the color and the quality of the cloth the curtains were made from but the picture panels did not line up at all! I know it said to allow for 1-2 cm but this is over an inch. I had to jerry rig (safety pin) the top to make it remotely line up! I know most people will probably not even notice it but I have OCD and it bothers me! I’d return it but I already had to adjust it to fit my window so I’ll just keep it and hope no one notices the discrepancy. It\\'s beautiful! Very good quality too! Better than I expected. Beautiful quality fabric and vibrant colors. Not stretched or faded like some reviews which I wonder if that was just an issue with one particular pattern. Definitely not the case with these.  I got the mountain pattern, which reminds me of Lake Louise in Canada where I honeymooned. Having these curtains in my bedroom is like peeking out at the beautiful view from a hotel window. Gorgeous These look pretty cool Me encantó el producto, bueba tela, lis colores  y diseños hermosos.<br>Rápida entrega Beautiful Christmas curtains for living room patio door and add the final Christmas cheer to the room! Good quality material. Good price. Very colorful, kid like it a lot.. These look so beautiful on-line, but regrettably their quality is not worth the price.  I have other, less expensive black out drapes that do not allow light to penetrate.  Product looks better at night, but it\\'s dark then.  The design is not crisp or sparkly.  Kept them because I needed them, but disappointed. It doesn’t look like the picture. I’m returning it. Used as curtains with lights for Christmas and they came out beautifully!!!  Much applause from the neighbors  :) I love the curtains they were a good size and have a cute picture It is slick enough that no one can see in the beautiful enough that I can enjoy it. Highly recommend it. By the way the cats like it to They are what was advertised Looking for new curtains for my sliding glass doors for Christmas / winter and found these.  They are heavier than I thought they would be, but that is a plus.  The curtains are 100% polyester and have a satin sheen to them.  They are not room darkening, but not sheer either.  I am really happy with them. I was looking for a curtain set to use over my sons closet and was hesitant that the quality would be low because the price was so low but I was pleasantly surprised to see the amazing quality and size! It was exactly as advertised. My son loves it and so does my wallet! Perfect. Just beautiful. Quality material. So very pleased. Great quality fabric is perfect thickness - not sheer/see-thru which I am glad because it keeps sun and heat outside. The room has cooled already. The print is just as expected - exact like in photo. These are crisp, rich photographic images printed on a heavy yet silky material that filters light. So there is a nice glow behind them during the day but they provide privacy at night. (We checked—all you can see when looking in from outside is a very vague blur.) I was ambivalent about trying them because the concept seemed a little corny. But I wasn’t loving anything else so decided to give them a try and am glad I did. They are so relaxing to look at, and so perfect for<br>a bedroom.  I can almost feel my blood pressure go down when I look at them.  Looks cheap. I love these curtains. Very beautiful and sturdy for the fall. These are not thin curtains they are nice and thick. What a nice surprise. I have to returned it. The design is not what I expected. It add beauty to the room. I love this curtain. Not only it arrived earlier than expected but the item is a perfect fit on my window, It\\'s a little bit longer but it better that way than short. I like the details put into making this curtain. Used these in a picture window in my kitchen.  They look rustic with the style of my house. I got it for my friend for her living room is small by hanging it by patio door became focal point as you entered, that extend the living room that add as inside and outside living looking on like a real view. I liked these curtains very much and they have very nice quality and heaviness in material. The image isn’t very dark but it gets the idea across. They are very nice in my opinion and used as a backdrop with lights against them they are beautiful I Like for pictures Love the look of barn doors and help keep out winter weather. Bought 2 of these for family on the mainland....to give them a small taste of home.  So many possibilities sew them together make a picnic blanket or bed spread.  Hang it outdoors while grilling to feel you are back home in Hawaii.<br> The other 3 are for us since we know the exact spot this picture was taken.  Love them! Looks really cool One curtain panel serves the purpose of covering a door frame so that the door can be left slightly opened without roommates looking into a bedroom.  Mostly different shades of green with brown tree trunks, green leaves, and yellow sunlight.  One tree trunk on each panel is olive green vs. brown which is a little odd looking.  Overall nice curtains. Returned it Love these curtains. They accentuate the windows. It does gives the area a beach scenery, which was my objective. Its worth the money. Go ahead and purchase Perfect for the winter. Ambiance is set. Perfect The curtains are beautiful, and high-quality, but the colors are not as pictured or described. They were described as \"yellow/ruby\" but actually turned out to be pink and purplish,  which didn\\'t fit into my color scheme at all, so I had to return them. There is no green in this. It is blue, so is not working for me. Close up, the pattern is blurred, not crisp, but should look nice from farther away. The curtains are a nice thick satiny fabric, but not too shiny. I would keep if green as described, so am disappointed. Awesome Christmas curtains! I used these in front of our sliding glass doors and they block light very well! Not 100%, but I’d say 75%.  Came out of the wrapping and hung for 24 hours and no wrinkles.  Thick, silky material and vibrant colors. How does one find the wrong wish list?  Well it happened!  Product has a heavy silky or satin feel and a very large image across.  Would not be room darkening or very warming, but provides privacy and a decor statement!. Not as heavy as I had hoped but attractive and fun.  The large rod pocket made them easy to hang. Just right As required Muy bonita cortina, mis hijos amaron el diseño The curtains are “ok” they are overpriced for the quality. The material is stiff. I posted pictures of the curtains at night and in the morning so you can see how it blocks the sun. I hope this helps. Beautiful Love these thick enough to block visual bedroom window but enough life and glow wake up to a beautiful day everyday. Looks ok but not thick at all, you’re going to have to use a double curtain hanger for it to look as advertised. But overall it works just not worth the 70$ they charge. Maybe 45$ The curtain looks nothing like the picture. One side is orange the other side is dark. The picture you see has details and none of those details are on this curtain. So disappointed, going to return. nice curtains This curtain is beautifully made, looks great. Okay, but cheap material which you\\'re mostly buying the print on it. Definitely should be cheaper without blackout backside. My son likes em and it\\'s what he wants. Upstairs sliding glass door.  Long and very pretty. Love these curtains! Almost like a nice backdrop for some cool cat pics too hahha The colors were definitely not as vibrant as the picture. One panel was faded, so I sent them back. BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS LOVE IT Item as described. Looks really nice Purchased this curtain to hang from a ceiling track to hide an ugly storage area in our bedroom. Works perfectly for the space. I like the pattern- neutral enough to not be too busy with everything else in the room but still a little pop of interest. The gray was more of a cool tone gray, but worked perfectly with our very pale blue walls. Came with 1 and not two curtains... Esperaba mas colorido pero a pesar de que el material es excelente, los colores me parecieron muy pálidos. good qualify and material was satin which made pattern look real We have sliding glass doors in our dining room and these are perfect. I have a boring blinds only, no holes allowed in walls rental at the moment and hate it. 3m tape only allowed. So I ordered these size 90 long and taped them on the wall above the window to cover the window, blinds and all. Wonderful and transformed the room completely. Adds a bit of creep with the grumpy moon, which I love, and other world escape that I like to feel when I am home. Love it!! No complaints at all! The material is very well put together. The imagery is simply breath taking. The was a good purchase and price was very reasonable. gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous! Takes up the entire dining room wall. It\\'s truly breathtaking to walk into the house and see this across the room. I love them get a long tension rod from on Amazon with it for like 15 20$ I think and it’s perfect Its better than I thought. I wasn\\'t sure if I was going to like it until I hung it up and saw it and its even better than I could have imagined!! This picture shows the morning sun coming in These are so pretty and they look like the paintings came from the temples or tombs of Egypt.  The colors are just like the picture in the graphic.  They are of a silky type material and have a white backing.  They do block out the sun if you are looking at these for a bedroom.  I have them in my Egyptian decorated den and they are beautiful!  Highly recommended. Ugly Love  Image is clean and sharp<br>Material could have been thicker Look great, as expected. Good quality. Delivered on time. They are putting me in a great mood!  Love these..super long..way better than I thought they would be..super pleased!! The curtains look great on my window thank you Beautiful up. Ils sont très beaux, entièrement satisfaite Love them!! Love these. Got for a Christmas gift haven’t hung yet. I do love them and I’m sure my son will to. Perfect drapes Doesn’t look as pretty as the pictures but will do!! I probably wouldn’t have paid the 60plus dollars if I would’ve seen more reviews on this set Very good quality! tres bonne qualité<br>livraison rapide<br>super<br>Merci I purchased these Ambesonne Wanderlust Decor Collection Nighttime On The Cobbles At Mermaid Street in East Sussex Cottages for bedroom #2 and am overjoyed that they are more beautiful in person, that they are made of fine quality, that they\\'re so serene and just transports you to another place; these curtains are so tranquil.  I could really get lost in the beauty of these curtains.  There were no funny smells.  Gorgeous!  Very Happy Customer. I bought this, because the sun pierces my eyes in the morning. I opened it, hoping to be satisfied, but they gave me a huge size, like something for a patio window or whatever those things are called, and they said it came with rods but it didn\\'t! If you wanted a smaller size it was more expensive, like bro. Make the smaller sizes the price that I paid for this, and the big size those prices.<br>Pretty design, but it was seriously a WTH moment They are very nice and look pretty. The material is sturdy. I loved every thing. It is beautiful. My wife loves them! Amazing  BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS LOVE IT Just what I was looking for. Fabric quality is nice. This transformed our guest room into a conversation room. I love these curtains! Great quality, vivid picture, and durable. They can with stand my cats and my toddler. And, they look great! Beautiful Very good quality, will get more, also shipped and received in a timely manner. The seams never did close. The left side was cut different where the seam angled from the top down to the bottom<br>Like it was cut wrong Absolutely beautiful! The material is heavy duty and the colors are super vibrant! The material is not what I was expecting. Picture colors  is not so nice Fills an empty wall, when you add light. Gracias Only dislike is it feels like a shower liner and had a chemical odor that got a little better days after opening. My wife loves the length and color and design of the curtains. Will order again from seller. Love them goes well in my living room I love the way it looks. After hanging  for a few hours wrinkles came out. It lights up my patio. Just exactly what it looked like when I ordered it. Great value for money. Love it Just as depicted.  Satin-like fabric and beautiful with the look of a painting. The color is magnificent  as is the weight. If you like brilliant color these are it Arrived very quickly!!! The material is awesome!!! They are vertical beautiful I love them look just like the pictures!!!  Great curtains very nice. These are not grey in color they are purple in color Design and quality is great! Thick quality curtain. The colors are vibrant a and sharp. I bought to separate different spaces in my retail party store, and I am extremely impressed! Excellent quality and gorgeous design and detail. I ended up hanging them on my sons wall so he could look at the huge map. He loves the curtains as tapestries! Looks just like pictured good quality material Kitchen curtains  they look beautiful product is very nice one curtain was slightly longer than the other but I love the qualityotherwise. All lined so not see through The curtain is OK. Picture is pretty good but they are DEFINITELY not worth $65! I love the colors ... I have 5 more windows to do Great quality and has really made the room. Used with a golden / yellow valence for extra effect. Love it...... I didn\\'t place an order for the Afrocentric Window Curtains.  The reason is because I feel they are over priced.  They look nice in the pic.  But don\\'t know if the texture or quality of the item is rich looking.  Thank you. Really beautiful.. Everyone loved it.  Great quality too Everything one of these items are up in the family room.  It is now complete and everything looks awesome! price is to much. Ordered these curtains & delivery was estimated for Feb, but they came in almost a month early! Definately did not expect that so that was a plus. I did order them a size up (length) to insure full door coverage. The house came with curtains but were too sheer for my taste. If these were the same sheerness we would have put them somewhere else since our windows have blinds but they were perfect! I stood on the back side with the light on and I could barely see thru them. The details on the fabric are amazing. Having been to the Eileen Dunnan castle this fit for our Scottish color palette & is just as beautiful as I remember it. Being picky and very indecisive on which curtains to get I am very pleased. I just got them so I have not washed but tag does say machine & dryer acceptable. I use them as wall backdrop in a hallway that had no life before i had them just hanging from a room divider system yo hide my vocak booth, since i relocated them now the compliments are pouring in. I may get a sets for spring, winter and summer now, since these really possess an Autumn motif. its working for right now. We put these up in the living room to keep out some of the winter cold.  They\\'re a little uneven at the bottom, but so beautiful that I don\\'t care about that. These are perfect for what I wanted, to cover my patio door. They are heavy weight, yet light can still shine through, which makes the beach scene come alive.  The picture is very clear and realistic looking, reminding me of our cottage view in Florida. JUST BAD! ALL THE WAY AROUND Great look!<br />However, Picture was look like 40% more Vivid but not bad.<br />I always play piano and i wanted more great looking on window for more emotion.<br />It helps more feel like Emotionally. These curtains aren\\'t sheer; they\\'re perfect for letting just a bit of light in but being opaque enough to be private. And they\\'re beautiful to boot. These are awesome. I wish I could find smaller ones for other windows. I love these curtains. Purchased for my son\\'s old world theme in his room and they go nicely. My husband isn\\'t thrilled they\\'re some naked dudes in the mix but alas, it\\'s history ;) Love them I purchased this as a room divider but I tried them out on my windows first. Let me tell you. I love love love this. I can\\'t stop looking at it. It looks like I have another room. I sent my mom this pic and she thought I added another room. The colors are vivid, it is well made and it will transform your space. I want another one. The design was beautiful, however when I received them, they looked faded and cheap. These are absolutely gorgeous. I actually enjoy sitting in my living room because of the pretty curtains I can look at Longer than I expected, and I even measured the window! I think I should have just waited to hang my curtain rod until I had the actual curtains out.  The curtains are perfect. My daughter loves them in her Harry Potter room. The curtains are made of thick satin. They don\\'t completely block out light but that didn\\'t matter to us. They do provide privacy. We are very pleased with this purchase. Not as vibrant as picture. One panel is brighter than the other.. Due to Covid delayed shipping can’t return Love the curtains, just wish they were blackouts The material is lighter than pic<br>More close to pastels Great quality! My husband said buy more I love  them! Please ignore my submissions and reviews. It doesn’t matter anyway. I put a lot of effort into presenting a quality review only for it to be rejected by Amazon for violating community guidelines and I’m not even told which ones I violate so I won’t waste anymore time providing reviews. Found the perfect size fit.<br>Beautiful print, high quality.  When the sun shines on it, the view really pops like a sunset.<br>Also works well as Video Conference background. The whole family love this curtain, excellent resolution of the image, excellent quality and thickness, vivid colors. good fit and just like the pitcher. My brother is bedridden and your creativity on curtains make him feel awesome everyday. He feels like hes not inside daily but at the beach and under the ocean daily!! These curtains are great!! Theyre so thick and nice plus the design is beautiful! The 108” x 85” curtains fit perfectly for my patio door, 10/10 would recommend This is a beautiful two panel curtain set!  In the Daytime it does remain dark in my son’s room.  The color slightly changes on the sky!  It’s really beautiful! And they are thick and well made.  The description is true to its description.  I can’t say enough about this set!  It’s great! I put these up in the apartment in our hangar. They look good. I put them sideways and they fit without altering. This made the windows wrong but it looks fine. very satisfied I am seamstress and know little about fabric for curtains. And I saw this fashion Christmas curtains . I am hesitant and doubt first what material and printing they might used so I ordered 1set and chose the lower price to try. I WAS SO SURPRISED BECAUSE THE ITEMS CAME BEYOND MY EXPECTATION.! THE FABRIC WAS MADE OF HIGH QUALITY SATIN AND THE QUALITY OF THE PRINTING IS EXCELENT. LOVE THIS and Thinking to buy more from this seller before the price up. They have  the right thickness and light. I ordered more I loved these curtains. It made my house very festive and fun. We loved taking pictures in front of them. (Pictures come out better in the evening when the sun sets)They aren’t blackout curtains. Some light comes through. If that doesn’t bother you and you’re looking for red and white Christmas curtains then these are great! Great product brought comfort also to match &nbsp;Love love love I feel like I\\'m in the galaxy  I SOooooo  love my my butterfly  drapes they are all that was said  about them I\\'m so elated  .I choose  them to HORNOR  my daughter  COURTNEY that passed  due to cancer  5yr ago we use to go to trinity college  in April  in her HORNOR  to let go butterfly\\'s. These  drapes  remind me of that..my heart is overwhelmed  Ilove them so much just perfect  Everyone love the curtains but I had to make it work. The description of sizes and measuring were not accurate. The width of my window is 104 the product was described as 110in  not true. Plus it took forever to ship!! I ordered in November and it arrived second week of December. Way overpriced!! I love the picture hoping it holds up under normal wear and retains the nice colors. One thing that bothers me is the price. I wouldn\\'t have issues with the pricing BUT instead of running an additional stitch to the header so they would hang nicer on the rod they are sewn together at the top to give a nice ruffles topper to the drape of the curtain on the rod. Her eyes don’t line up, she looks more like a woman drowned than a mermaid. Not meant to be sheer, which is fine.<br>Excellent atmos-fear.<br>Playing Nightmare again will be a blast!<br>Great drapes!!!!<br>Happy Hollermean! I have now ordered 2 different Ambesonne curtains and my biggest problem is that I can’t hang them up at the same time, lol. I will be buying a different set for each season. Just love them! Used them for Christmas and they made a perfect back drop for our tree. So happy I bought these curtains, saves me having to paint a wall or frame a mural/large painting!<br /><br />I received it today, and makes me smile every time I see my living room wall, absolutely love it ❤️❤️❤️ When you look from the outside at the windows you see mountains. It is so neat!!!!!!!  It made our dark no sun room look majestic and bright. When my package arrived, it was the best feeling ever. After unwrapping, I took one of the curtains out to see it. It was perfect, it looked exactly as in the photo. Then horror struck my face once i looked at the other one. The second curtain had faded areas already. It also had these weird black streaks. Even though I’m returning it, I wouldn’t say it’s a bad product. I just think I was the one of few people that their product got messed up by a machine or something. I absolutely love it. Not at all as pictured there was only ONE yes ONE girl between the pair and not the two facing each other. My son uses it as a closet curtain. Works great! These curtains are awesome, I love the look, very relaxing... They are absolutely beautiful! The colors are vibrant. Exactly what I was looking for! Love them , super cool! I think for more visibility of the doors , black out curtains behind it makes it easier to see wht it is  but nice for the money The stitching is not straight on the bottom so it make the curtain look crooked. It\\'s really a block out curtain,  it\\'s very thick<br><br>But the printing didn\\'t work for it,  it looks ok in pictures but not in person..<br>I sent it back,and will keep looking Love these curtains. So colorful Looks just like pic and when light comea through makes it even better They are very pretty. They allow some light in but not too much. In my photo I have a sheer curtain behind them and the photo was taken in the afternoon on a partially cloudy day. Returned. I ordered the wrong size and didn\\'t like the design once I saw it in person. I really like these curtains!  They look great! I like the fabric as listed the colors are amazing and so clear  advise you purchase one. was everything i was hoping for the quality feels in the higher end looks awesome .highly recommend. Thanks a lot for this very interesting high quality curtain it is fantastic . Very nice.  They give privacy but also look great.  We use them in our beach themed room.  They look great. The colors on these curtains are very rich. Adds a nice touch to a room I was cutting off. You wouldn’t know there was a room behind these curtains. It does a great job of keeping the warmth in or the cool out. One panel was longer than the other. I had to hem them because they were too long. The measurement was wrong. It stated 84 x 180 but they were about 106 x 83. This was a little short. But can make it work The stars are not very bright. Happy with my purchase. Nice section divider for our basement. I am completely satisfied with this product. A little thicker material would have been nice. The only problem is the design is hard to see when the sun shines through them. Great addition to my workout area. Beautiful curtains ! White/black. Pattern doesn\\'t match in the middle.  EXPENSIVE I was searching for curtains that would keep others from looking through my husband\\'s office window without blocking the natural light that he depends on for his work. The panels do not reduce outside noise and have no impact on the cost of utilities because they\\'re not thermal backed curtains. The print quality is fine. The design is not blurry. Both panels are the same size so the pattern lines up like it\\'s suppose to. I went with the shorter length so it looks like a picture hanging on the wall because my husband was so resistant to traditional curtains. If you\\'re looking for something that works like a light weight tapestry but has a rod pocket, these are ideal for the price. These curtains are great! Colors are vibrant! Material is good. I\\'m more than pleased! Thinking about adding to my bedroom! I would recommend to anyone. 01-21-2021<br />I ordered another pair and they\\'re great! Absolutely enjoy this curtain. All the colors are very vibrant and the curtain does not allow wind through it. Nice material with a backing. I love the colors and the art work. It\\'s thick and the fabric is beautiful Item was supposed to be new and unused.  Item was definitely NOT new or unused because you could tell curtains had been washed since tags on curtains were faded and NOT crisp and new.  Would have loved the item if it had been NEW and UNUSED. Esta Hermosa!!  DISAPPOINTED  This is true to description. I’ve got it in a hallway so when the door opens it’s almost translucent.<br>Would definitely encourage the buy. Well worth the extra money. Worth the price for sure. I was happy about that. Perfect, thickness of curtain is nice. Very vibrant and pretty. The bedspread set like this is awesome too. Shipping takes a very long time. But was well worth it. These are perfect for what I needed them to beautify a basement that is under construction.  They are good quality.  Thick not sheer.  I do not need them for warmth. I like it I can spend my whole day looking at it<br>I can’t  describe  how much I love  it definitely I will bay it again These curtains are meant to be a picture. When I received them I took one out to be sure it was what I ordered. It looked correct, so I put it back in the package. I just got around to hanging them and discovered I was sent 2 of the left panels, no right panel. Not ok. Looks Great! I\\'m pleasantly surprised with the quality of this material!  It\\'s vet thick and the picture quality is amazing! Highly recommended. They are very light weight, and we found we need to use another layer underneath to provide some darkening in the room.  Other than that, we are very happy with the appearance and they received the nod of approval from the boys. Bought 2 sets and I absolutely love them ...definitely recommend I love it! It adds a western touch to the room w/o being overwhelming or juvenile. The satin feel is wonderful and they came quickly and well packaged. The picture I posted was in the middle of a sunny day. I just love these curtains. Theyre so unique and a perfect accent piece while being functional. I love them all. Hoping to cheer myself up. Can\\'t go to the beach so Im bringing it to me. One inside and outside. They bring the beach into our room. It’s a lot of pastel colors.  I was looking for more depth like the picture showed.  I’m sure I’ll find use for these but it wasn’t what I was looking for.  All colors are way to light. These are so cool looking! Fit perfectly for my husbands Mancave! Decorating my home I wanted to replace our old, broken, cheap, horrible vertical blinds that hung over the sliding doors to the backyard. I thought about curtains, but decided to get a \"view\" type curtain instead. We LOVE the country, barns, horses, and everything that goes with them. I was excited to find these curtains in a size I needed. They are a nice material. Not thick, but not see-through. They will not block the light, but that isn\\'t want I needed. I just wanted something different that would look good. It\\'s not the best photo because I need to wash/press the wrinkles, but I LOVE these curtains!! The white on the right curtain is a reflection, it is not THAT see through. Privacy Good Quality<br>Made in Turkey First of all these are regular curtains. Please do not expect room darkening or blackout properties. They do have a nice thickness to them which filters the light coming through. I didn\\'t expect them to have thermal properties, but the room where they\\'re hung retains more heat in the winter. The pair were enough to cover our sliding patio doors and the print is true to the description photos. The curtains are lovely. Returned because it does not look like the picture advertised. Love the pattern.  Just what I ordered These are amazing. They don\\'t charge enough. The material alone you couldn\\'t afford. Buy them. The material is a thick polyester with quite a sheen to it. The colors were nice and bright but the heavy drapes didn’t work in my small space as I was hoping. Good quality overall and well made. love how it blocks the light an its not a thin material its most impressave Fit perfect nice material. Change the whole look of the room!  I love them This is the first curtain I\\'m buying online. I loved the picture but once I got it, it looked more like a bathroom curtain. It took a while to get some waves into the curtain due to the thick material and the rod pocket top.  I would love if you could add the grommet top option Excelente calidad. Muy buena la tela. El diseño es igual al comprado. super thick! love them Looks great...but I received 2 of the same curtain sides... But I flipped one over and it works... Curtains are hung in the living room. They are very flimsy.  One of them tore when it fell from my hands as I was hanging them. Not a big tear, but a tear none the less.<br>Only one of the panel orders came with the choice of either hanging thru the rod or with the option of hanging thru the strings on the back of the curtain top.  That was disappointing. Many people said it has a shower liner feel but I believe that’s an exaggeration because it made me think “plastic”. I’m glad I still bought these curtains because it does NOT feel like plastic. They are pretty thick and the color is vibrant. Great product Lovely and better quality than I expected. Exactly as described. My mom got me a set of these and I do like them but I didn’t realize they cost so much. After I found out I decided to write a review. There are pretty the way the light dances through them and creates nice lighting, but are very cheaply made. I definitely do not think they are worth the money. If they cost $20 I would say yes but wow what they want for them is rediculous. Warmth, sheerness As advertised. Good print, soft material. These curtains add character and calmness to our classroom. They are much higher quality than I expected! There is so much detail in the printed image that my students were able to find people walking on a trail and a fish or frog (they haven’t come to a consensus yet) in the lake. These totally change the feel of anywhere you may decide to hang them. ❤️ beautuful relaxing  Very pretty .Just what I wanted These curtains are beautiful!  At night you have a gorgeous ocean view but in the daylight, the sun hits the white in the moon and water and clouds and they just glow. I just ordered a different view for my living room. My biggest con to these curtains is they we\\'re not sewn even. This has turned out to be the most fun! The material is so soft and enjoyable. The print is vibrant.  I have a small room and cant do a permanent wall mural. This style curtain is a wonderful option. I bought the longest curtain rod that takes up 2/3 of a wall that only has a small window. I love how it makes the room feel so much bigger.  I am looking forward to the next room makeover and picking another curtain like this! So I ordered alice in wonderland curtains with her looking through and received curtains that looked like a bloody door. I exchanged them so I hope the one I get is the correct one. Over all though quality is good and they looked well made.... if you want bloody door curtains for your dining room I love these curtains. They are excellent quality and are great if you love nature! these curtains are absolutely gorgeous mind you they are not complete blackout curtains but they are absolutely gorgeous I am very well pleased with this product high quality I really enjoy them and they look great with my fall and Autumn decor anybody who loves these kind of designs or pictures these curtains are worth the money Love these curtains! Beautiful in person &amp; look just  like the photos.  Thanks! I think is pecfect for the room These are beautiful!!! Every year we have a Halloween party and I like to change the atmosphere to reflect the theme. This company sells floor to ceiling curtains that do the job perfectly, much better than using vinyl photography backdrops. I attach them to our walls with staples and they photograph beautifully. The image of the arches is clear and will be perfect! Very cheap material for the price. Also, photo of item looks like there is a cream color in the fabric when in fact it is stark white. Love them they match my pillows looks nice with my living space don’t know about the bad reviews but thanks seller I love curtains‼️  They’re just sheer enough‼️ I love greenery and these makes me feel like I’m outside, and gives a whole new look to my family room‼️ Nice design but cheeply made, feels like it\\'s made of nylon. Muy buenas Very good Quality my boys love them When the light comes through these curtains my daughter\\'s room becomes this wonderful forest where anything is possible. These curtains transport you to a hidden forest. They are incredible. Love the curtain. The nature scene on the curtain brings the outdoors into the home. Nice quality curtain. The print is not bold but looks very nice both during the day and at night. The color is vibrant.  Material is a medium weight.  Usi g it as a walk cover to hide ugly wallpaper.  Easy to see put up  good value.. Would not buy again....the product quality is nothing compared to the picture online . Love these curtains! Great quality very nice feel,  just the perfect touch for my office/ kids guest bed room for whenever my grandchildren visit. Perfect fit and let\\'s just the right amount of light in. It\\'s exactly what we were looking for! I really love this curtain. I took my closet doors off and have this instead and it matches my teal walls beautifully. Not sheer from what I can tell bur I did not put them on a window. Super product, super quick delivery, super seller. The curtain is so beautiful. It lets in so much natural light while still providing complete privacy. I was concerned there wasn\\'t enough tree pattern, but actually it is perfect. Beautiful focal point for our kitchen. Loved them Love the colors, durable Material and craftsmanship was fine but the print shows pixels which is hard to see in the product image. I ended up returning due to the print clarity. If up close they looked like what I could see on the picture on my phone, I would have kept them. Just as pictured These look fantastic. Very glad I got them. Silky but still think and well made. For some reason I expected these curtains to be sheer. It was my fault because the seller does not mention that. However, they do add a medium amount of the insulation to our room. Terrible. Look nothing like picture. Look like they came from Wish.com I added them instead of Barn door for my closet and they were just what I was looking for. My son loves these curtains.  Impressed with the quality.  Nice heavy material. Loved it! It is exactly what I ordered Makes my dining room feel like a cozy space to enjoy a meal in. These are great for my \"moose lodge\" themed living room.  They look fantastic and let in just enough light.  One thing to note.... The are one sided.  But there are second curtain rod rings if you want to put another one behind it. Disliked the length.  Liked the fabric quality, picture quality asks printer. Beautiful to look at.  I thought it was 84 inch long.  Read for correct measurements . So pretty and soon feel. Worth buying These curtains do not look at all like the picture! NOT cherry twig  and no wood wall background  Very unhappy with these curtains These are quality curtains, especially for the price.  Exactly as pictured, very pretty.  Shipment was next day.  VERY happy with purchase.  Thank  you. Cheap looking scene and low quality. These are well made curtains I get lots of compliments on them It looked bold and gaudy. These curtains are so pretty. I feel tranquility when I look at them. Was sent curtains of a beach scene, not what I ordered, and they are poor quality. Am returning. Will order polar bear curtains elsewhere. Very nice. You can\\'t see through them. Odd, I look at the curtains in my mirror and I see faces! I was worried these would be “over the top” for my husband and I’s bedroom but they are so pretty. I was pleasantly surprised that they block out so much for privacy. I thought I was going to have to double them up with another curtain since we have neighbors that can see in our windows. The first picture is with the bright Hawaiian setting sun shining at the windows. They are not garish or too girly (hubby approves) and they really make a room special. There are so many colors to pick up on with other decor too. I was nervous to wash them but the wrinkles are hanging out much easier than my other curtains. Love the material and just the right amount of opacity. Rod pocket was a bonus for me! Nice hems too. They\\'re perfect!!!! No bad words for them they\\'re magnificent!! The height was perfect as I install them over my sheers so I could have them hand baseboard height.  As the pics show, during the day, light comes through very nicely.  At night, with the light on they really show their beauty.  The image quality is excellent.  I am absolutely thrilled with them. I didn\\'t realize how busy this pattern was until it was hung up on the curtain rods.  Nonetheless, they\\'re great quality and well designed.  I  were hung in less than 5 minutes. Not as nice looking in person. Plus there is a road in the background that distracts from scenery After 3 months, I haven\\'t recovered it. Had to cancel the order. Very pretty. First one came and i received two of the same ones, not as pictured so reordered and received the same thing again. The picture shows one fairy blowing. I keep getting two fairies. I want the one thats pictured.  I emailed them and they simply said to return it. Not helpful. Its thick and ita pretty. We are using it for closet curtain. If you’re looking for sheer, these are not for you!!! They are of great quality and beautiful. They are rich in color and I would buy these again in a heartbeat! Well made, came as described, love them! They look like the picture, great background for my virtual office. Love these, at Christmas time they made my living room so festive. These curtains were just what we wanted, a similar scene to what we get with them open.  For the price they were nice and heavy, not cheap. I added sheer panels in the middle. I love them; it makes the room look very peaceful. Beautiful Great quality and print is awesome. Great quality! Not see through. Fabulous print. Works as advertised. I LOVE my curtains good material the photo is identical to the picture shown to purchase 100 percent Recommend Nice quality and very modern looking. They are very busy so we paired ours with black. Beautiful curtains I’m using to hide old mirrored doors on my closet.  They look great and make my bedroom look more open and inviting. The beautiful warm colors are fantastic. The best value for the money I could have received. They look great with solar system themed room. Great choice! Cheap looking, color is uneven, distorted photo appearance. Not worth the money. I have been buying these scenery curtains for years. I love them. They make a room so much prettier. Love the picture design. Not a warm fabric. Longer then I intisipated. Very misleading... I thought the figures would be smaller and more defined to match my hyroglyphics pictures on my wall... verrry disappointing... Maybe they don\\'t allow bad reviews for some reason, but I paid $63 for this set and expected a quality print. Clearly they printed the mermaid way closer and RIGHT next to the ship so there is no ocean between them and it looks ridiculous with shell on the second one, but even on the same window it would be too close and distorted. The mermaidbitself looks stretched out and slightly distorted as it is. They sent the COMPLETELY wrong set at first, so don\\'t get your hopes too high. Apparently quality control is lacking. I am incredibly disappointed as this was my guest room and my kids room with all of their books so I was SO EXCITED for beautiful curtains!! I wanted it to be jaw-dropping, not awkward! Color is beautiful and so nice fir a room. Got 2 or these for my patio for privacy. They look great. Nice thick fabric and washable , dries fast without dryer. If you want something sheer or see through this isn’t. Wished it wasn\\'t so sheer can\\'t enjoy the picture when sun is out or during the day, it look great when there\\'s no light coming thru.  Other than that it\\'s lovely Great quality and really pretty These curtains are beautiful make my room more cheerful and keep coldness out don\\'t feel Draft from bay window Beautiful picture of nature❤️❤️❤️❤️ These are beautiful Works perfectly for what we wanted I bought these to hang in the back of my booth. I have a 10 X 10 tent and thought it would be a fun look for my Steampunk business.  Nice fabric, thinker than expected. The colors are vibrant and printing is clear. Beautiful details. Good weight. I love them so much These curtains were dandy. Unfortunately a little too bright for me so I ask for return. The seller was wonderful very cooperative and helpful would buy from again. Love the color and the thickness. Exactly what I wanted! Curtains are perfect ! Great product for the price. Looks exactly as pictured. like really shiny. not my taste or what I was looking for. the shine throws off the print imo. I used this product for my bedroom windows and they help hold the heat in good in the cold weather I love the pattern it\\'s very beautiful and calming and relaxing to look at it actually helps me to sleep better at night especially the moon light print I like that you can\\'t see in from the outside but you can still see from the inside out a little bit and some sun light still shines through they are semi thickness and made of very well quality.. Doesn’t look like the picture. It has an off putting mixture of purple and black. I love my window curtains The flowers are a slightly different color. Still very pretty. These are really pretty. They’re a good thickness, not too thin or light. My only issue is that they’re made of silky material, so they’re shiny. My husband jokes that they look like I made them out of a silk robe. Other than that I love them! I absolutely love these! They make it look like my windows look out to a beautiful forest, instead of a dull grey city scape. I love the way in the morning the light shines through them and creates a beautiful colored light in my room. They feel thick in material, but in the daytime they do allow some light in which makes the pattern appear a bit washed out. But in the night when there\\'s no light on them the colors are so vivid! I bought the item for the pattern and it lines up perfectly!  I wish the flowers were a little slightly deeper red, but I can live with these.as the pattern is very pretty. Nice, long, opaque curtains.  I\\'m using them to hide some pipes along a basement wall. Just right! Love the color and design. I have these curtains up in the living room. While they are pretty, they don\\'t block the sun very well. It\\'s hard to see the tv when the sun is out. The curtains are thicker than expected, if your looking for sheer these are not for you. I like the thickness of the curtains, bamboo designs are well printed. You cant see through them from the inside out and vice versa. In the pic you can see how much natural light comes in (10am) which is perfect for what I am looking for. The only issue I have is, I lightly pressed them to on the lowest setting of the Iron and the leaves transferred onto my ironing board cover, attached picture. Aside from that, the curtains are very well sewn and have a medium weight to them. Wasn\\'t like the pic. It looks more like a shower curtain. And images doesn\\'t line up with other half of the curtain. They worked for my purposes, cheap room dividers. Bright colors, easy to hang They are white on one side almost looks like shower curtains Measurement is incorrect.  Hem is uneven.  You may have to alter before you can use these curtains.  I did and not happy about that as I am really busy with a million other things right now. Love these curtains looks like I\\'m waking up to a beautiful view every day.  They are just dark enough but also let\\'s light in so its not dark. When the sun shines on the curtains makes it feel like your really there.  They are beautiful Got exactly what I ordered with this purchase! Extremely excited to put them up got the matching Duvet to match them! What a great price too! Would recommend this seller! These curtains will blow your mind with how fabulous they are! One of my most favorite purchases.. it is amazing and affordable! You really won\\'t be sorry Sewing looked cheaply made They don\\'t look as rich in color in person, like the pic. Definitely good quality material though. Loved the design. Looks exactly like the picture. Very very nice but without the curtain holes like most curtains you find these days they didn’t flow well when on the rod. Would have kept them if they had the holes to thread on the rod. Very sheer The colors are brilliant. The fabric is heavier than I expected but very quality. They are absolutely perfect. They really bring life to my living room Great curtains of the golden gate! Picture is a bit pixilated and faded but its good enough. Bought a set and love the way they look and feel. The only issue is that on one side of one of the panels, the seam wasn\\'t sewn straight and that edge is cockeyed. not a disaster, but you can see it. otherwise, love them. We love them would recommend to any looking for a rustic look I love my new curtains Having 9 kids curtains don\\'t last. But these are perfect Like the photo nice and clean Giving two stars cuz the material is fairly nice/thick and sewn well, however, the material is very transparent, light comes thru easily and makes the colors look purply/pinkish rather than grey.  The image is not clear and looks cheesy almost cartoonish.  Returning. The material is more like a shower curtain than a window curtain.  Pretty design. These curtains are good quality material  I put them on my windows for Christmas and they seemed to keep moat of the light and cold out. I love the Christmas feeling they added to my house The curtains are beautiful. I bought these for the picture so I can look at something other than the building across from our apartment.  We also get sun coming through our patio sliding door in the afternoon blinding us. These curtains mute that very well and look like a sunset (see photo). The bottom isn\\'t even so took a star for that. I drape this over two green screens behind me as the backdrop for my teaching Googlgle classroom area. Good product.  Fit perfectly and it is durable. Love the design but I\\'m very disappointed with the false advertisement. If you look at the 360° view of this curtain then you will see that it shows there\\'s the printed picture on both sides of the curtain so that you can see the print on the outside of the house as well. Upon receiving the product the fabric facing outside is completely White and this is not what I was looking for! Material could’ve been thicker Great quality The drapes are beautiful, heavy, &amp; well made. The quality is great, but I took off one star because of the misprint. (shown in the pic) It\\'s been like a shower curtain. But it\\'s not plastic like a shower curtain. You cannot see through it all though it\\'s like you\\'re looking through a shower curtain. It is not warm and it does not warm anyting. I wonder why they even ask that question on this review It\\'s on my bedroom window, well made and silky feeling. Very nice!! These are super sheer and ugly. I am so embarrassed taking them out the package in front of my husband he lost his mind at what I paid 80$ for. They were meant to be used as a room divider but I wouldn\\'t use them to clean the floors with. Super satiny shiny cheap material. Absolutely saddened by this purchase. The backside is extremely sewed back so whoever saw it from the other side would have a sight for sore eyes. These are not worth the price being sold for at all. I can understand the labor and printing costs but material????? No thanks. I didnt even bother hanging them packed them right up! These curtains are just beautiful. Thay art not meant to be sheer and they are backed in white which prevents sun fading. I highly recommend them. I wanted to bring the gorgeous mountain outdoors indoors and put them over my french doors leading to deck, which is exactly what they have done. Very cheap!! Picture of the curtain is not the same. I call the curtain ugly. Amazing Ordered new item, item was obviously used. See picture for hair all over adhesive. So disgusted, going straight back. These are beautiful curtains.  They are a great weight- not too sheer- hence the 3 rating.  They are not intended to be warm but they add a beautiful warm mural like quality to my room. The colors are bright and they hang beautifully. I would buy these again. Bought these for my mother\\'s birthday. She\\'s redoing her theme in her bedroom to barn and horses .<br>Looks AMAZING!!! Loving them Just as described This was a great price for such brightly colored high quality curtains. I am very pleased with the addition to my bedroom. These aren\\'t sheer. The image is nice and sharp but the blue is a lot brighter than the image. It is exactly what I wanted so value for my money wasn\\'t a consideration.  I used them to cover a very large closet.  Warmth of a curtain? The colors and pattern are great. The fabric is silky and smooth. Well sawn, although there is a 1-1/2 inch difference<br>in length where the pattern meets in the middle. Excellent product, great quality, perfect size to block an entrance and look as if you are looking to the environment. I recommend to anyone. Sent me one panel not both and it smells horrible. Very unhappy Love it...looks great Loved the curtains! I love these curtains. Great quality and let the light shine through JUST enough to add extra beauty. purchased to cover sliding glass doors...to help keep florida sunshine from eating up my hardwood floor while keeping winter chill outside. Beautiful and practical at reasonable prices. Thank you So nice looking, my closet got transformed, looks like a castle window. This curtains are immense,  makes the living room looks like a heaven. Hide the back yard Curtains are wonderful.  You can not see through the curtain but when the light is on in the room you can see the same picture outside.  I love these curtains. material dislike<br />the product does not look the same as image. Not well made.  Do not drape well. Love the curtains the price was high but i like them The cloth is high quality except for the print. The beauty of the bird and the flower was not expressed well. It was like the drawing was rained on. It faded. Great texture and design! It’s thick! Really feels like the sunrise is in my room. I love it! &nbsp;It\\'s foggy/un-clear. Looks like a forest fire. Pitiful, send me a crisp visible one like you advertise, not your trashy stuff. Extremely unhappy. Wouldve liked it if I didn’t receive two different curtains . Didn’t feel like refunding because I got this to he temporary any way , but not worth the risk . What a garden of Eden.  They are perfect and the detail amazing. I just recently ordered these beautiful curtains and I love the way they look in my living room window! However, the defects/flaws spoiled the look!  After opening the package, I immediately washed them (according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions); I allowed them to air dry and ironed them on a low setting.  Much to my dismay and disappointment, I noticed the flaws after the curtains were hung.  The curtain design in some places, had bled and left purplish-black lines or spots, (not part of the design) from the artwork itself, and dark lines on the tops and bottoms of the curtain in a few areas.  On another area of the curtains, there was a white spot or stain (not part of the design, but on the white part of the curtain).  I don\\'t know whether or not I can still return them because I discarded the packaging.  I would like to reorder, (I purchased 2 sets--4 panels, to accommodate my large window area), but I am afraid the same problem may occur.  I waited so long (nearly 4 weeks!) to receive these curtains, only to be sorely disappointed with the material and design defects!  I hope no one else who orders these otherwise beautiful curtains, experience these defects.  I am still contemplating reordering them because they are just what I had envision for the window area, and they do make a beautiful, eye-catching attraction in the room; but I really don\\'t want to wait weeks and I don\\'t want to reorder defective curtains!  I hope the set of curtains I ordered were anomalies and not the norm.  I hope the seller and/or designer will read this and make amends to their product, or reach out to me and see what can be done.  Thank you. This curtain is so gorgeous I’m going to order a second one for my living room. The only thing that’s different from the picture online is that the white is a pale rose color but it’s so gorgeous it will go with any decor. I’m using this one in my dining room will attached pictures after I’m finished with painting and furniture. I was soooo excited about these curtains. They matched my room decor perfectly! Problem is when I received them, I got two of the same panel making the design pointless. I  contacted customer service about getting the correct panel I was missing and their response was to just return them. :-( now this print isn’t available so I will have to figure something else out.<br><br>The curtains are very nice quality and I’m absolutely heartbroken but for $70 I really expected better customer service The product is even more beautiful in reality. The fabric is thick and high quality Better than expected. I really love these curtains but I didn’t realize I was ordering curtains, I wanted folding screens. I was sad To have to return the curtains because they are delightful cherry blossom pictures of the trees in bloom. Very happy but sturdy curtains. It\\'s alright. I wasn\\'t disappointed. It was a week late and looks nothing like the picture. Love them they hide the ugly apartment bi folding medal doors and and warmth and a personal touch A perfect background that can quickly become a Star! I Absolutely Love this print, that is why I gave it a 2 star....However, as you can see by the photos I have included, the set of curtains I received Absolutely did not match.  One panel was Purple, one panel was yellow.  Either color would have worked, but not one of each.  The material is definitely flismsy and thin.  I knew that going in just by reading what few reviews there were.  It was All About the Print for me as there plantation shutters behind the curtain. Terrible and truly not worth the money. Very pretty and was exactly as written. beautiful  curtains I sent them back because the wrong size...and they were thicker than i wanted...but they were nice curtains.. The picture isn\\'t as clear as I imagined it would be.<br>The image looks blurred.  I did not like these curtains. Shiny polyester material, the print was terrible, nothing as vivid as the pic, more like pink blob.<br />I must say that the return was easy, and painless. Took them to ups with my qr code droped them off, recieved my refund. Way more than I expected. Double lined and so pretty Thank you, it look so beautiful on my patio door. Nice curtains. I love it We hung these over my daughter\\'s 9 foot span of windows in her bedroom. They let in the sunlight because they are thin, great for her, bad for someone who likes to sleep in without sun. It makes her room look like she has a feature wall even though it isn\\'t. Inexpensive mural, expensive window coverings. Only took the cat one time to try to climb the tree before it ripped a small hole in the curtain... oops. Not animal friendly. Love the concept!....I have to find the clock! And matching items! These are beautiful and so unique. Gave my home the cabin feel.  So the go fabulous with my wood walls.  They are definately not a black out but they do darken the room. nan Panel sizes not equally consistent. One is shorter than the other. Also folded sides not equal to each other This is a deal breaker. Poor quality control. When the sun shines through it in the morning it\\'s as if a forest is coming alive in the bedroom.<br>Lightweight and beautiful artwork. I love it. Didn’t look like pictures These are gorgeous drapes.  Much finer than I expected for the money.  They are heavy and luxurious.  Very high quality. this was advertised as blackout drapes, THEY ARE NOT!! Slow start as first set arrived with two of the same side...took a while but finally received the corrected<br>version. The watercolor painted poppies curtains are really artistic.....Love them!!!!!!<br>Lenda The perfect look for my yoga studio; bright, yet thick. Beautiful colors to enhance any mood. Value for money My apartment has many Alice theme items and these curtains add to the theme. They are bright beautiful and worth the money. Wanted to have an ocean view.. now i do! looks really pretty .. Like the design, but not worth money. Bought awhile back finally got a chance to put it up. It’s not even line up. One side is higher . Lol. Was expecting darker red flowers. More like pinkish coral color. my bdrm. as described Fabric felt like a shower curtain instead of a curtain you would hang in a room I LOVE THESE CURTAINS Came out to be beautiful and exactly how I imagined it ♡ This curtain clashes well with the color of my livingroom. My livingroom consist of all of the colors of the curtain, absolutely beautiful. Everything Love it. Can be hung as shown or opposite direction with the scrolls in the middle<br>Lines up beautifully I loved the picture but the seams were puckered. They could do better with ghat Loved the photo of 2 flowers. Unfortunately mine did not look like that an due to circumstances i did not get to hang them until it was too late to return.  I have 1 flower spanning the two panels Wife loved it Nice... a little on the light side for weight of the material and the colors are light(faded) but I made them work They’re beautiful!<br /> I would have preferred a ruffle (gathered) effect at the top... but maybe the theme does not call for ruffles... they’re beautiful— longer than I expected... makes my LR with my African prints look sooo cozy... Like I bought it for my mother in law for Christmas in 2020 and she live in Florida her caretaker put the curtains  up for  Easter for the firts time and they where not the rooster curtains, instead they where in rainbows! She was  very sad when she has everything in her with roosters. I thought  it was to late to reclaim<br />WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR A 101 one yr old? Was exactly what we were looking for.  Used it to separate two rooms. I liked the fact that it looks really good at the window and I believe I made a smart purchase based on the material, and quality. This is thick sturdy material. The colors are bright and rich. I love it. Was exactly what the description said, very soft material. I like the unique bright variable colors that blend well in the room. The quality was fair, for the price we were expecting more. Fit great. A little long but great. Such beautiful, soft, curtains. The picture is clear and not at all grainy and the material is well stitched and very soft to the touch. The curtains black out just enough light to prevent glare but lets enough light come through to make the colors in the image pop. And the 2 halves of the picture line up perfectly, when you have them lined up the right way. (Lesson learned lol). Absolutely Love....love....LOVE these curtains!! These were beautiful.I used them in the front room in my canal side condo and they really transformed the room. Very nicely made and strong material Did not fit the wendow it was supposed to fit Not as big as I thought Love to shop here, you get what u see. Love everything I have personally ordered. I had sliding wood doors on my closet and they kept falling off the track so I decided to make my closet look like a huge window and ordered these curtains for the backdrop.  They do not show thru and the are heavy so hang very well but still slide to open &amp; close.  They worked perfectly for what I needed Very shiny really don’t look real when you put them up These panels are extremely well made and the colors are vibrant. I have cats and though they aren\\'t destructive they can inadvertently damage fabrics just by being cats. These have remained perfect in the months of hanging since purchase. I am very happy and would gladly purchase from this company again. Pattern and material is awsome Too short and they showed this very long. It was too short, lengthwise and width, for my windows. The satin material I thought is not a nice curtain material . It really helps set the Manhattan theme of the living room<br>EXCEPT<br>They sent us two right panels<br>We are missing the Brooklyn bridge :-( When I posted these to social media, my friends thought that I was in some club. Love the colors in these. This is the 3rd pair ive bought so I can change them out. I LOVE IT!!!!  Looks great!!!!  Thank You!!!!! love it-packaged really well-thank you very much--kat En la parte de abajo de la cortina no tiene un corte parejo, los extremos quedan más altos que el centro de la cortina, su tela es de buena calidad y el dibujo  y colores son bonitos I like the fabric and the brick design on them. The colors are great. But once hung, they are not straight on the bottom! One end of them is shorter than the other side. This was the case for both panels. It’s a shame I didn’t try to hang them as soon as they arrived, because I missed the return window. I am out of the money and now looking for other curtains to replace. Skips these unless you are handy with a sewing machine and can fix them yourself. Great quality and just gorgeous,  looks just like picture. Can find a place where this could be used it is so poorly executed and the orange is horrendous color. They look just like the photo. Completely opaque. I bought the white brick one. I thought it would be more realistic. But, it is more like a cartoon. Nice and pretty. Looks good, works well. Like it it works but graphics aren\\'t that good This describes two panels. Our package was delivered with only one. These Old Jetty curtains arrived quickly in perfect shape. The scene is all Autumn colors (browns, tans, yellow, orangey, but very little green). The scene has a calm feeling, perfect for our cabin\\'s bedroom. They are 100% Polyester woven in a shimmery cloth (satiny look). The leaves on the water have a sheen about them. We are using these to cover a bedroom closet opening, not a window (so tired of closet doors!). Inside the closet is a dresser with a television on top, so it was important that the curtains opened and closed very easily over and over. I was a little concerned because they have a rod pocket instead of metal grommets, so I made sure to get a skinny rod with a middle support for the weight. They slide very easily on the skinny rod, probably because the fabric is sort of slippery, like satin is. I can\\'t answer about sheerness because we are using them for a closet opening --&gt;the whole scene shows up beautifully without a backlight when not on a window. The mid weight polyester isn\\'t the best fabric, but all my hems were sown well and I am keeping it. We own a retail store along the coast and use this curtain as a back drop throughout the Christmas season in our display window. We have 4 large, display windows and purchased a different curtain for each one.  These are not sheer curtains; we did not want sheer but do allow daylight so they are perfect.  The quality of the material and value for money is impressive. &nbsp;Love it!

Beautiful curtains but quality control needs to be stepped up matching panels together. Palm panels are dif shades. Also 4 panel 1 image spread is needed for those of us with double doors. Tighten up qc, nice product. The curtains are nice quality and we were pleased with the first one we opened.  When we opened the second one there were brown marks on it. Great asset to my beauty shop. Clients love them! Love it  For the 65 dollars i spent these curtains SHOULD OF HAD A CLEARER PICTURE. The tiger looks washed out. The scenery looks DIGITAL. Maybe worth 40.00 not 65.00 plus tax!<br>Also the length should of been wider with that hefty price.<br>They need to drop the price down. For the fact that the curtains look washed out and foggy.<br>I also hung a smaller curtain behind this one to keep the sun out as these curtains are not black out curtains. There not sheer but there not black out. If that makes sense.<br>Anyway i give these curtains 3 out of 5.<br>As i didnt like how dim the tiger looks. Or how digital the scene was. Like badly photo shopped.<br>Might keep them as it matches my safari cheetah print rug. But wish i knew before hand the cons. I love the curtains Very nice design received lots of compliments about it. I like the scenery, too long for the patio and not wide enough. I have it packed away. Beautyful and good quality! Many folks think I\\'m crazy but I just think outside the box.  I have a good sized AZ room and ordinary just will not do. But your curtains express me perfectly. They give flashbacks of my RV trips. The light coming through the curtains take me from sunrise to sunset. It just didn\\'t fit in my AZ room.<br />May use it outside on my gazebo. Does not look like picture, the picture shows white at the top, and the floor doesn\\'t look like picture,  deceiving. Look nearly real if one irons or. Ours is still wrinkled. Doesn\\'t look good on the window The different lighting options made this curtain look different. In some light, it looks royal blue, but in others it looks navy. It’s true colors are white and royal blue. Shipped well and packaging protected the items. I did have one concern with the threads on the seam as they look like they might unravel easily. The weave of the curtain fabric looks too wide for the stitching. I also would have preferred a second pocket for the option of a ruffle on top. Muy bonito igual a la foto I love it it\\'s thick great quality I only wish it came in a longer size. I love the look of the curtains.  It gives the crisp summer feel that I want! Makes the room lighter! Oh my goodness , these drapes are beautiful and hang elegantly. They don\\'t wrinkle. I\\'ve tied them back and when I undue them there as beautiful as they were after I ironed them. I suggest you wash in cold delicate dry then iron the folding crinkles out. Most magnificent for there value. I also hung from ceiling which makes it look so elegant. Beautiful. Allows to diffuse light and brings the picture to life Very heavy and good quality not a black out but it does help some what. I just love the way it looks I love these curtains. I am a NYC girl born and raised, but moved upstate and miss my old stomping grounds. These curtains make me smile. The curtains look just like the picture displayed and depict Manhattan just as it is. The curtains allow the morning light to pass through and really gives the room some pop and personality. They arent sheer so you cannot be seen from the outside so there is privacy from the neighbors. 2 thumb up. They are cute but in reality it’s two shower curtains substantial material I returned the product. Did not like it at all Beautiful Butterfly curtains that made a bright spot in the room.  It was our first venture into buying curtains without seeing them first, and we were hesitant.  But all was as promised.  Then we noticed when we hung them, that they did not hang correctly.  The inner seams seemed to be bunched up, hiking those ends higher than the rest of the two curtains.  We also did not like the dark seams down the middle where the central hems overlapped--seemed to stand out on a white curtain in our bright window--so we returned them.  The return was as easy as could be.  We boxed them up, took it to the Return Store as indicated to us on the phone, and Amazon took over.  It made us confident when it came to buying more because of the easy return, if we needed it. This curtain is a nice heavy material, &amp; is beautiful! A little high priced, but is high quality fabric. The picture is clear, the color is good, and really makes the room seem more open. It blocks out a bit of light, but not a lot. If you live in an apartment and don\\'t want to use their blinds, this offers privacy and you can\\'t even see the picture on the other side. The only thing I have to say is that the picture looks stretched, but with the size I ordered I don\\'t think there\\'s much you could do about it. Thought they would have been thicker I wish I could afford all of them. They are very nice. Love these!! Even though I’m not waterfront, I still wake up to the beach everyday These curtains did not arrive as pictured at all, and we had to send them back. The design was much bigger than in the picture, and the fabric was very shiny. We ended up finding the right ones on Wayfair. The material is good and I love that looks so real you would think it\\'s outside the window! This is an extra one that I bought, if I could I bought all of them there beautifull. I love this curtains, make me feel like I\\'m at the beach in Hawaii,I use them for my living room and for my dinning room. And for my family room, there\\'s nothing to dislike,love them. Colors looked faded and hemlines were uneven I took my sliding closet doors off and put these curtains up. The curtains are BEAUTIFUL!! They are hung from the very top, so ceiling to floor pretty much. It takes up a good portion of the wall--108 inches, and I barely have them scrunched/bunched together. You want to see the entire scene, or at least I do lol, so they are pretty much flat like a wall....The material seems to be good quality. They are not really sheer, but some light can get through. I\\'m not using them over a window so that\\'s not an issue for me. I love these, they\\'re well sewn at the seams. The scenery matches up where the panels meet in the middle. I will be buying other scenes when I\\'m ready to switch it up. My husband wanted these curtains and he loved them. In my house it’s not if mama’s happy (HA) it’s if papa’s happy. But they do go great in our log cabin. If you like that rustic look I recommend these. Looked like tuxedo curtains, Didn\\'t like them at all  I like the curtain itself for the size and the material isn\\'t bad at all, but the picture of the curtain doesn\\'t look anything like it does in the product listing because the picture quality is pretty bad its basically a close up of what you see in the product page, I am just glad it didn\\'t come blurry it\\'s just a close up with a low resolution. I personally do not recommend this at all unless you want something cheap looking Very Pretty, I love the Ambesonne designs.<br> Unfortunately they have alot of visible black marker lines from where the stitching is marked. Can\\'t use black on white fabric.<br>Color is blues and aqua blues, white at top fading into warm whites at bottom except for the marks, full length of the curtain, nice quality<br>Light comes through, but you can\\'t see through them. Do not buy it Beautiful The curtains are described as being Red and Yellow.<br /><br />Actually, the majority of the leaves are orange.  There are two or three that are red at the top where the curtain rod is located.<br /><br />I wanted a color scheme that was more red, NOT orange! Curtains are pretty but I didn’t realize the black swirly lines were going to be so outstanding over the background. All I could see was black scribble. I may have reviewed these before but, I\\'m going to say again, I love, love , love these curtains.  They are beautiful, well made, and I just absolutely love them.<br>I have two different sets, from this company. They are both really well made, nice fabric and very fun to decorate around I bought two different sets of desert scene curtains. Both were stunningly beautiful! They are photo perfect,with so much detail that you can see the sunlight glinting off the individual spines/glochids of the teddy bear cholla. I am from the Sonoran desert and every morning when I wnter each room where there curtains are hanging, it feels as if I’m looking out the window. The width and length are exactly as specified. The price was unbelievable for the really great quality. I was expecting for there to be some kind of catch so I was overjoyed when I opened the package.  These curtains have probably saved my sanity now that I’m stuck in the city :) Hermosa y buena calidad ! This is my most favorite scene; the late afternoon sun bathing the glorious Sonoran desert with brilliant golden light . You can see every detail with a stunning amount of clarity , even the spines/glochids of the cacti.  These curtains are stunning , the fabric quality is great, the measurements are exactly as specified. The price was so good that I was actually expecting them to have some sort of flaw but they are absolutely perfect! I’m overjoyed! It\\'s nice. The pattern is really cute! With that said, for the price that I paid I was kinda hoping it would\\'ve been made with a better material. The  colors are so vibe and crisp. I love the designs. Third pair of Ambesonne curtains I\\'ve purchased.  They are all beautiful, extremely well made, and exquisite material.  They wash great too! Gives the living room a different look. I really like it but its a bit expensive. lighter than photo and crooked on bottom The panels are not as nice as they claimed! The material is on the cheap side and the hems all have numbers and bar codes on them, so I got the END OF A BOLT so it seems. The material doesn\\'t give at all.  WOULD I BUY THEM AGAIN.. NO they are cheap looking and feeling, if I could give a -0- I would! I was going to buy these for my kitchen windows - then I saw the same pattern on sale for my glass slider and had to go for it. The price was right! These are very well made and a very nice material. I got for $30ish dollars. They are worth twice that much for sure.<br>They\\'re a little long than I\\'d like, but I am very happy with them! I would buy this brand all day long. Very nice product! Beautiful well made curtains. Color between panels is fine for 2 panel yet I have a double sliding door and matching panels with a duplicate curtain the colors tend to run strong left to right only.  Note to computer color quality control  A little thinner than expected but love the colors I bought these as a gift for my dil.  She replaced her bi-fold doors on the bedroom closet with them giving them some much needed space in the bedroom.  She absolutely loves them. Simple design. As advertised. It is absolutely beautiful I really like these curtains! They actually make me smile, even when I don’t want to. They light up a room, and also give a feeling of serenity. I’m elated with this purchase! I would post a pic, but…I’m uncomfortable with permissions. These are pretty cool! we put them in our bar to cover the sliders, and they look really nice.<br>Well made, great quality. i put this one on one window, and the sunset scene on the opposite side of the room. In this picture as presented, each panel has a whole image of the butterfly lady, so there are two images in the two panels. But what I received has half the image in each panel such one whole image is formed only when I drag the two panels close to each other. This is fraudulent and a deceit. You entice people with a romantic image and send the a different thing all together. love mural curtains easy to clean no ironing vibrant colors what a perfect curtain for my sons guitar theme I thought this product would look great on my sliding glass door the pictures online look wonderful, after getting it the fabric was cheap and see-through. May be okay for someone else. These are pretty cool! we put them in our bar to cover the sliders, and they look really nice.<br />Well made, great quality Was not happy with these curtains..<br>Can barely tell its a tiger on them....very disappointed Love the gothic look Exactly like the photo Great colors<br />Could be more thicker \"Wow\" same as picture love them so much the view is so perfect like a real tree<br>Thks iam very happy with my order. It does give you that relaxing feeling. Nice quality print.  I have much love for astronomy and these curtains do not disappoint. These are beautiful vibrant curtains but the hemline stitch length was different on each panel so that kind of bugs me, otherwise a nice quality curtain. &nbsp;I love everything about it, the water, the trees, the bridge  no I got them from my kitchen window and they are so cute. But I wish they weren’t so satiny for the kitchen I should’ve purchased cotton material Be warned, the print of the design is different for each sized curtain, my kitchen has 2 sized windows so i bought 2 diffrent lengths pkus a valance and the treats are huge and distorted looking on the longest I bought (63\") all together it looks silly. Dissapointed. Overall quality of curtain is nice tho. Excellent product  Nice quality and very pretty colors. just love it so much-packaged well-tysm kat The red looked darker when I ordered it. It’s brighter than I wanted. Material is like what you get from wish These curtains are so cheap looking. They contain no embroidery or anything to make them worth 65 dollars a pair. Basically, they are a picture printed on cheap fabric and the picture appears to be awkwardly stretched at parts and looks awful. Do not waste your money. I returned the product when I saw how ugly they were. Vibrant colors looks amazing hanging up brings everything alive. Thank you Print is clear. Everything lines up on both sides perfectly.  I am so very pleaded, works perfect in my new FARM HOUSE rustic decor room. Lovely curtains and good quality fabric. Wasnt sheer<br>Thick Perfect as described. Muy cómoda, y la talla correcta. good look Absolutely beautiful breathtaking extremely happy with it they\\'re gorgeous very nice quality I have attached photos of the curtains - in day time, in night time and also from outside the window.<br><br>And as you can see, they are very pretty and very bright. Just lights up the room.<br><br>It is not see through but it is also not fully light blocking. You can see in the day time that light does flow in, though not much. The shutters look like stripes. These are absolutely gorgeous! I mean top of the line quality, Look, and feel. Simply beautiful. Bring the islands to your home, in the summertime. My favorite curtains!! Feels like our bedroom is vacation Product was exactly as described. Not sheer or thick perfect to let in some light. Durable material an easy care. It\\'s like a forest in my bedroom. I love them I liked it very much thank you These are by far the best curtains I have bought ,they are everything described and more . I love them, my neighbor\\'s  love them and so do all my guest . Get them they are worth every penny ! Used it to cover a pantry opening.<br>  Now looks like an opening to my dock These are intense. They make my tiny apartment look like a log cabin. I only wish they were darker. The light shines through extreme because they are very thin. They don\\'t look good too sheer. Paid $64 today they are price at $24. It\\'s NO for me. TRASH!! Very nice & would definitely purchase again. Bright, vibrant colors! These were an amazing design. But completely didn\\'t block any light whatsoever. And wouldn\\'t have been useful if you need to pull back. This would have been awesome to cover a patio door if someone didn\\'t use it much. But I needed a little coverage for my living room window, so I returned This is great, I\\'m doing my bedroom as a castle and this really set it off. In the picture where there is light matches perfectly to the window. I\\'m very happy and the quality is above and beyond. If you\\'re wondering whether it looks as good when delivered, yes it does. Nicely made. parece una puerta, bonita y diferente Awesome, good value , good quality, easy to set up , we love it. Absolutely love I love these curtains.  I have a hallway that I wanted to break into two spaces for some privacy.  These worked great for me and I like they pattern. Lovely! I put these in our bedroom. To overpriced When I seen it come in mail wasn\\'t to impressed The material is as stated, satiny, just not my style;-) The scene did not look lovely like on the computer. The return process involved two unusable labels and I found it extremely frustrating. When I e-mailed Amazon with my frustrations, they gave me a 100% refund with a gracious note of apology. Now that is what I call customer service. Life is imperfect.  When people/business make things right, that goes a long way in my book. I love it make sure you have long enough windows so it won\\'t be too short or too long These are beautiful and they truly block out light Amazing curtains. Just as pictured. Beautiful design. Balanced colors. Goes great in my bedroom! They are high quality material. Not what I was expecting at all, guess my expectations were not that high but I was really impressed. Its hard to impress me. They are for my husbands train room. He loves the realistic look. 5+ The prints did not match/line up. The material is not great. Buena calidad ..buena tela...linda It is very difficult to find a set of curtains with this design. I was very excited about finding these but when they arrived and I hung them up they did not look exactly like in the webpage picture. In the webpage picture they look more elegant but when you look at the dragons they have an almost \"cartoonish\" quality to the drawing, in particular the eyes of the dragon, which ruins the look of it! The overall design of the dragon is basically not what I expected and the material is not what I expected either. I really wish I would have returned it but with no other alternative to this style and color kept it, and going to try it with a different bedspread and see how it works I only wish they were blackout curtains otherwise perfect To big I liked the curtains.  As a matter of fact, this was the second set I purchased.  I ordered the long and they sent the short and then just ignored emails. Love it! Made my living room look absolutely beautiful... Very nice,  very well made.  Good quality and great colors . Love it I bought 2 more for the family room.  Good price A very beautiful curtain.  It looks great.  The material is of high quality, transmits enough light, but does not darken.  Just fine.  I am very pleased with the purchase !!! Beautiful veiw! The sheerness is perfect. It leaves just enough light thru in broad daylight that it don\\'t make the livingroom too dark and the picture is lit up nicely.gives the livingroom a beautiful hue and feels cozy.material feels nice and durable.would definitely recommend. Seriously guys… these are soooo nice. The color and texture is awesome. The quality is really good and the price is right Wrong Size. Picture great. Awesome! My boys (5 &amp;3) are having so much fun with these curtains. They keep asking Alexa to tell them a fact about different countries. I’m even learning things I never knew about places!<br><br>They are a thin material so if you want blackout curtains you’ll need to put something behind them. The top has about a 1.5 in opening for curtain rod. I use this in a guest bedroom lit up by a blazing hot sun. The room is shielded from sun glare and helps to keep the room much cooler than before I purchased it. Looking out the window is a stone “half” wall. So it matches well. Shields the hallway from blazing sun in late afternoon with brilliant colors.  I live in Arizona and all say “wow” to the extra view it offers.  Great choice for me because of the compliments. Good quality. Heavy duty which was surprising.  Not black out but thick. Easy to hang - presewn rod pocket. Lov e them and recommend. I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter - she loves it! Love the forest look, really transforms the room into an oasis from the daily city madness life. I bought the biggest size.  It really is WALL art. Details and weight are great. The picture on the curtains didn\\'t look like a tree and the colors didn\\'t relate to a tree as seen in the photo.  This curtains were perfect for our nature theme room. The detail was amazing. We are happy with our purchase. Loved these curtains. They were practically perfect with the decor of my living room. Only problem was they were not long enough. I needed 84 length not 63. So had to return them and I have been struggling to find a replacement.  If they ever get them in the length I need I will buy them immediately.!!!! With a kitchen remodel, I wanted to create a new look with a focal point. Drapes can be dull and non-descript, but not these! Cuts glare and heat, but keeps the space bright. It feels like you are outdoors. Super value - I could purchase three different designs for the cost of the one heavy thermal panel I replaced. In fact, when I got on the site to look at various options, I was really hard pressed to choose JUST ONE! Want to relax at the beach? In the mountains? In the rainforest? Looking at a city skyline? How about a view at the airport or out an Italian villa? Literally, there are hundreds of scenes to suit your fancy as well as seasonal drapes for every holiday. These drapes have a lovely finish. I will be buying another set just for fun and because they are so affordable. You won\\'t be disappointed. I gifted my brother this because he\\'s an professional poker player. It was a major hit. I bought this for my adult son because he likes space, but they are not the color shown, very sheer and childish. They are absolutely gorgeous for the price These curtains turned out to be better than i expected! Heavy weight but not too heavy, gorgeous color and print make them a hit in my surf/ocean theme guest room! I am thrilled with them as they also match the bedspread I purchased. I definitely got the value I was looking for with this grouping. Thank you Amazon for carrying such a great selection of bedding and window treatments! The curtains match my bedspread that I purchased in the surfboard theme with the palm tree. They tie the whole room in together and make a quiet, relaxing feeling of being on the beach! Love these. Love the pattern. Love the thickness. Used to divide a room. Listing is not accurate, ordered this twice and received a night sky... no night sky over national monument<br><br>quality of curtain seemed ok otherwise Very adorable. The overall package brings joy and satisfaction to my eyes. Thank you so much. I love art and everything in it is just absolutely perfect. Thank you. Love the product. These don’t block out a ton of light but the colors are gorgeous and true to the pictures. I ended up using a double curtain rod so I could put another light blocking curtain behind when more darkness is needed, though I really like how pretty they are with the light shining through. The reverse side is white. The astronaut themed curtain replaced my 40 year old faded yucky curtains from a long gone era adding excitement to the room. The two curtains slipped through my curtain rod easily. These are not black out curtains and were never advertised as such but for you day sleepers out there, get some blackout liners and all your light problems are solved. I used some duct tape to keep the panels together when I run the fans to keep them in place but I might add snap buttons soon enough. Love these curtains have them on the porch by my hot tub great feeling at the beach! These are very nice and work great for RV as a room divider. N great scene!! Absolutely love it! I turned my garage into a playroom and used the curtain to cover up the ugly garage door!! The kids LOVE it!! Very nice pattern.  Fully lined.  Great value. This beautiful beach scene just lights up my room<br><br>Especially when the sun shines through<br><br>My grandchildren point and giggle and it just brings me joy These are hanging between my dining room &amp; office.  They offer privacy, with enough light filtering in through the day.  At night they block out any Nosy Nellie\\'s.  Nice quality, durable plus a beautiful scene. I bought those curtains twice, first time in 2018, second time now. These are not the same curtains.  They are advertised 90”, my old ones are 90”, new ones are 87,5” (but still advertised as 90”).  Top pocket is different as you may see at the pictures. My old ones are great quality overall, and wash pretty well. New ones are great quality too. I wanted them for another window in the same room as the old ones but the difference in length is huge - I am returning the new ones. I feel like the old version was better, length was as advertised and the top pocket was not stiff. The new pocket is made of something of a plastic feel, very stiff and cannot really put curtains on the sides of the window,  they slide back towards the middle because of the plastic stiff pocket. I would like to purchase the old version that was 90” to match my old curtains but if I was buying first time I would not mind 2 x 87,5 for both of my windows. They are beautiful, but not 90”, and  don’t match my old curtains. I absolutely love love my curtains, the quality is wonderful, in my opinion.  I am very pleased with the overall look of them.  They exceeded my expectations. Exactly what I was hoping it would be! Does quite well at matching up in the middle, I was a bit worried about that. Sets up a relaxing scene. I love, love, LOVE them!! Allows some light through without “washing” out the colors! Muy útil para closet me faltó una medida más ancha y más alta. Smaller than advertised. I am greatly disappointed because I splurged on expensive curtains and this is what I got.  The dark stain is VERY obvious and ruins the whole piece.  I will NOT be able to be certain that a replacement will be here in time for what I planned on using them for, so I get to decide if I \"put up with it\" or return it entirely because I won\\'t get a replacement in time. Great quality, add a old door look to any room.  Looks amazing. Great quality I love it and I will order some more but next time I will order a longer one like 84, 90 or 96 inches. Misleading Living room Only one quarter of the curtain area had full ink saturation. The colors on the remaining 3/4 are sort of dull. They\\'re a nice heavy weight and I\\'m not picky enough to send them back since they\\'re hidden in the bedroom, but if I ever order from this company again I\\'ll inspect it very closely. Very happy customer. High quality classy fabric.Matches perfectly. I love the picture the curtains make, the fabric isn\\'t as soft as I\\'d like. These are beautiful. Great fabric. Two curtains. I\\'m using it for a backdrop for my Sunday School kids program. Perfect. Love the looks of these curtain but reading the description i figured they be alot darker ..lets a lot of light in.. These are very high quality curtians. Thick and soft. The colors are j 6tty st as described and they hang beautifully. Beautiful!<br>They are not sheers, if anything they are room darkening. These curtains are absolutely beautiful! I was a little afraid they would be too sheer but they\\'re not. The color in the fabric is just gorgeous. Good find. I would recommend. This bedroom curtain is perfect. Just as described snd even better than expected. Value for the money The quality of the material and workmanship are very good.  Unfortunately the satin material is too shiny for the room where I would hang the curtains.  I am returning them, but this is turning out to be complicated.  I would think twice before ordering from Amazon again unless I\\'m absolutely sure the product is satisfactory for my needs. very heavy and Dark like I like even goes with everything in my room. These look really cool and dramatic.  Not the best quality control...hems are different lengths and don\\'t meet perfectly.  But I still like them because they are so far from typical boring curtains. It looks bad in real Awesome curtains bring beauty to my home I love them. They give the room a lightness while also providing privacy. They\\'re so pretty and just what I was searching for. Poor Qualiry. It was not cut and sewn evenly. Had to keep because no time to get anything else. Overall I will replace with something else when I get a chance. NOT worth the 60.00 plus dollars spent. I love this curtains .they look real and give me the feeling of a beach in my backyard . Thick material and no see through . Great colors too . Looks very real These curtains are perfect. Better than except. This product is not sheer. Using it as a mural and it should have universal appeal for all nature lovers. I used these curtains on our enclosed porch to reduce the heat coming through the windows on a sunny day.  Nice quality fabric, and cute pattern for kid\\'s play area.  Excellent price for the size of the curtains. Probably want to put a black out curtain behind this one, but quality is amazing, size was perfect. The product has a good quality. Arrived on time. The price is not good, but is not bad either. But the size, if you need a 84\" high, forget it. Its like 82\" maximum. In my case, the bottom part is missing 2\" . In my pictures you can see what 84\" looks like. Perfect for Pride! Heavy weight! Absolutely gorgeous. I just don\\'t know what else to say other than elated with this purchase! I like the soft, but up-beat rustic appearance these beautiful curtains give off when the sun touches the outside of the windows in the daytime.  Then when the light brightens the room, these beautiful curtains instantly commands a glance so as not to miss their splendor.  In other words, the texture and blend of fine fabrics are assembled together to create a great feel and look to any room. Love this curtain so much. Colors are beautiful and blocks out the sun Really great quality.Exactly as promised. I love it Very nice thick fabric.  The design is more like palette knife/broad brush stroke oil painting than photo realism.  Very bright and vibrant oranges and yellows which allow in light but still soften it. They are gorgeous !!!! Fabric is wonderful quality as well. I love these curtains and makes me feel like I’m looking out of the ocean I would order those again in a heartbeat These curtains are beautiful and durable, I have a kitten that keeps climbing them and they have not snagged!!! Great quality Purchased for use in a classroom where sunlight was hot throughout the day, they were awesomely perfect! Beautifully designed and great room darkening ability! Worth my time and money thanks so much! I’m certain the little first & second graders will thank you ! I highly recommend! Love everything about this product - thanks!! I ordered the 108\" x 84\" and these are all of 81\" at best.  Also, they are not even at the bottom, which I could have lived with if they were the correct length.  I\\'ve ordered this brand of curtains before, and love the scenic view they provide on my glass doors.  I think I\\'ll send these back for an exchange and see if the next pair is the correct length. Fingers Crossed! Really looks nice when the son hits it and dims the sunlight Awesome Luxurious.  Many compliments from people entering my front door. TRÈS BEAU MAIS LE TISSU EST UN SATINAGE ASSEZ ÉPAIS ET LE BLANC EST D\\'UN BLANC TELLEMENT BLANC QUE JE DEVAIS REPEINDRE MES MURS.  J\\'AI RETOURNÉ LE PRODUIT ET PAYÉ DES FRAIS DE RETOUR. Es justo como se observa en las imágenes y coincide con la descripción, colores muy vivos y gran detalle. Excelente relación calidad precio y lo mejor, llegó en tan solo tres días.<br>Lo recomiendo ampliamente, es la segunda vez que compro con este vendedor y en ambas ocasiones los resultados han sido satisfactorios. It\\'s just beautiful,  quality fabric and warm colors and design.  Better then I expected, have it hanging outside on our covered deck..<br>Bought another one The Tuscany Vineyard Design hanging in my Dinning Room on the wall.  Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!<br><br>K M SHEEHAN Awesome makes my living room look great They are just sheets of printed polyester. They are too thin to be any use as curtains even worse there is no way to hang them so they drape.<br><br>They are just sheets of polyester clearly designed to be used as a wall hanging. I do not like them at all very distressed to have bought them. I got these curtains on sale and they were worth every penny. They go well with the musical theme I chose. They are durable and easy to hang. Thinner thanks I thought they would be.  But really look good. Lovely image of a beach and nice curtains overall. I took a star off because the curtains are thin and the barcodes are imprinted on the actual curtains, which doesn’t work well for a room divider. Beautiful! And very thick and well made. The image is exactly as shown on the website which I was really worried about when I ordered. I\\'ve gotten some real crap in the past. Very very happy!! The church use it for back ground I love the floral pattern in these drapes. High quality, bright design! I know the price is a tad expensive but if you love color and want a punch of color in a room, this is the drape set for you! My mom and I each have a narrow window in our offices, so we each took one curtain. Just beautiful! Heavy fabric well worth the money!!! Made my living room look great! Love these curtains. Came exactly as pictured, very nice material. Was great for hanging in an opening to help contain my air conditioning to the main room. Very nice, soft, thick fabric, vibrant colors, excellent stitching. I put them in my gazebo. Absolutely love them Loved quality and style! Gave My bedroom a whole new look! The curtains are NOT tan and blue. They’re pinkish (salmon?) and blue. I would return them if it wasn’t more effort than it’s worth. The wildlife is nice and clear and I like Anderson 3-D scenic curtains and shower curtains  The curtain had the same quality thickness, yet this time even though they’re supposed to be a missed in the background it just looks like someone took bleach and painted the waterfall in the background instead of a misty look plus the land looks blurry.  Wish it was clearer.<br>Bought several types of 3d curtains before &amp; will continue if continue to be interesting &amp; clear Material is not cheap and flimsy.  Excellent price for the high quality. We own a mountain cabin, so the pattern works in our house. This material is 100% polyester so it\\'s best to wash in cold water and hang them up to dry on their own. They kind of have a \"plastic-y\" feel to the material (like a thick shower curtain) so a dryer will probably scorch the material. But once they dry, they hang nicely. Beautiful! Perfect size for my window and thick. Allows some light to come thru.  I\\'m very happy with tge choice I made. This goes very well if you have an Asian theme. Love the colors. I\\'ve not set em up yet but when I do, I\\'ll update with pix. If you want something different, something eye catching then these are for you. I\\'m tired of what my boys call grandma styles and colors that the department stores offer. Sorry Grandma, no offense. I love you. I have not set these up yet but I did spread them out on the floor. Beautiful. Eye catching colors. Gotta make some room to set em up then I\\'ll update this review with some pics. My boys are happy I\\'m getting rid of my grandma style curtains. Perfect I purchased this to cover the eyesore of a furnace in my basement, now gameroom. It looks great and the size is perfect. Excellent and fast shipping! Thank you! These are so beautiful  Decent product,  it\\'s ok. Not as darkening as I was led to believe. THESE DON\\'T  LOOK ANYTHING  LIKE WHAT THE  PICTURE  SHOWING Great product Looks great!!! Love these Pattern does not match up looks odd when hung Bought this for my nephew who loves nature, he loves loves these curtains. It took me a little to see that it was uneven from the right side. the printing didn\\'t finish the door correctly. The curtain looks very nice. Living in the desert and having a green landscape to contrast the desert brown around me is a good eye relief. I have now ordered 3 different sets of curtains from Ambesonne. I use them as a mural in my living room and I change them seasonally.  Each curtain set is stunning, very high quality, and I am so happy with these products I’ve recommended them to many friends. I adore! I haven\\'t used this yet but it looks really beautiful and quality. I\\'m not sure how it\\'ll be once I wash it but we\\'ll see. The kids love it. I used this to replace their bifold closet doors because for some reason they break everything they touch. These have been a good substitute. I was very pleased with the Incredible look it gaveto my living room.  The only thing I wish is that the panels would’ve been wider other than that very pleased! The curtains are amazing and high quality. Nice product The color and coverage is great but the picture of the lotus isn’t that obvious the way it hangs on my window. I may end up replacing these sooner rather than later I love my beach curtains thank you Absolutely beautiful!!! A perfect addition to my tea cafe!!! Absolutely love the sunshine though the forest feel of these drapes. I like them so much I plan to purchase them again so I can hang them in the study which looks out on an uninspiring parking lot. They also appear to be quality made. I think I will be happy with them for a very long time. I put these up in my bedroom. I love the feeling of sleeping in nature. I think they could be a little bit more darkening but I can fix that. They are pretty cool with the daylight coming through too. They have a kind of glow This is a very neat curtain.  It is has room darkening material.  It is one piece (white is backing).  At 108\" width, very wide.<br><br>My idea for use was as a hanging \"headboard\" for my medieval room decor. It covered most of my wall, which would be perfect if I had a KING size bed.  I could not make any adjustments because of the design.  So I had to return it and chose another which I\\'m hoping will work. These are thick and really great quality material. You can see light thru them a bit, but they cover really well and you wont notice if you are not using them to divide well lit areas. Like a kitchen or other room with lots of lighting. Still impressed by the coverage and material.<br />Now, the only down side which i was really unhappy with and took me FOREVER to hang them over. When you have the 2 pieces and run them on the rod, the top seem where you run the rod though? REALLY UNEVEN. And i mean an inch one one i bought and 2 INCHES difference on the other! When you drop the curtains after running thru the rod, the difference is so great, you have to hang the bar, then go to one side of the curtain and literally try to roll it back to match the other side to get the design to line up. it was a total pain! I had to use 3 hooks for the rod length, roll one side up an inch or more and use the hooks for the curtain rod holder to make it stay rolled up just to get it to match each side for the design lines.<br />This took WAY to long to hang due to this for both sets I bought. It was not just this one set, it was with both sets i bought. the seems at the top are completely uneven in the sewing/hem for the rod.<br />I made it work, but man did it take TO much work to get unevenly sewed curtains to match?<br />You can see thru this one a bit for the door shining thru on the right. Then look in the center of the curtains at the bottom. see one side pulled up just  to match the lines? These are thick and really great quality material. You can see light thru them a bit, but they cover really well and you wont notice if you are not using them to divide well lit areas. Like a kitchen or other room with lots of lighting.

If you look in the center at the bottom, you can see where it \\'starts\\' to pull up and uneven. couch hides most of it thankfully, This is because of the uneven hem for the rod at the top. I had to tape it for this one an inch up to make this one even.<br />if you are not in a well lit area, this one is really pretty tho toward evening when the sun starts to go down. The quality of these curtains is excellent and the print is perfect. I wanted something subtle but fun to hang in front of shelving and this Paris scene is lovely. The colors are as shown, very soft and blend so well with the neutral theme I have in the rest of the decor. I am very pleased and have enjoyed these for several months. Well worth the money to find a quality decor item as these curtains. Very vibrant colors. I chose the the mountain scene because it reminded me of Alaska. I am hanging these curtains outside to use as a theme. I really like this living room curtain now I\\'m looking for a sheer white curtain  Pretty Thick material and great quality These curtains are absolutely gorgeous. They are nice thick curtains, just beautiful! My son loves his curtains!! So cool These curtains are so realistic, I could stare at them for hours, it looks like you’re really looking into a mountain scene, they are so gorgeous and they have this beautiful sheen on them. As I live in a small appartment, I wanted something that would give depth to the room by being pleasant to look at when I have to close them.  Well, these panels absolutely meet my expectations !!  They bring warmth by being colorful & inspirant.  During the day, I leave them opened.  Two photos were taken early in the morning when the sun is facing my patio doors (so look pale but still an amazing effect).  The only thing I had to do is to cut about 2 inches each sides of the panels (as they were a little too large for my window to give better effect) and I will just sew them and will be ok.  **NOTE:  The material is a little bit rigid before washing it.  After washing the panels, they were perfect.  I am  very happy !! True to color, very nice print. It is exactly as the picture. Colors are vivid. The scene depicted is serene. Received curtains not the print I ordered. Hate doing returns so I guess I use them.  It was 5 inches shorter than i expected  We used this for our master suite doorway because our kids like to come in and it never fails that one of us is trying to get in the shower. The way the master suite is set up, when they come into the room, they can see straight into the shower area. This curtain fixed all of that!<br />It\\'s VERY pretty and it\\'s thick too! It\\'s also like have an art piece in your room that also functions as a privacy method. Looking into getting another one so I can switch it up from time to time. Love it Excelente The curtains were absolutely beautiful but they made the room too dark. Not “blackout dark”, just not as much light as I wanted.<br />Even though they were just as pictured, and well made, I returned them and went with sheers. Unbelievable print quality.  Looks great - particularly when the sun filters thru them This is a very beautiful scenery. I particularly use this in my bedroom to use as a cover for a closet door. This fits perfectly and it makes the room feel like you\\'re on vacation. I would highly recommend this to anyone who\\'s looking to enjoy a beautiful view. nan Love the satin material. So beautiful . will always buy from ambersonne . very fine quality . now all windows are covered with these type of drapes. Thank you so much I put them on my picture window in my living room. It adds color to the room when they are closed. Nice I have a room in my apartment that has storage area that was looking cluttered, it is a pretty wide and tall. I needed it to cover it up and bought these amazing curtains, and now its a very zen and peaceful room. It really makes you feel like you\\'re waking up to a serene forrest. It was worth every penny!!! I used a tension curtain pole for the length and I was surprised that its holding. I dont think its sheer, but at the same time I am not using it for windows. I have them in the guest room.  I painted the wall a nice muted green and the room looks very calming.  I\\'m so glad I took a chance on them!  :o) Not long enough<br>Found a better spot now they are perfect❤<br>It\\'s like having the beach right there! Love this it fits and looks perfect ❤ They are great in my sunroom looks so realistic the clouds and sunset when the sun hits them Very disappointed these curtains are very long and very wide not for a room window like they show in the pictures. This curtain is perfect because it let\\'s light in but you can\\'t see-through it Great material and image but I needed to hang them at the edge of the ceiling and they still have extra dragging on the floor. These must be made for extremely high ceiling homes ? It didn’t look realistic it looks more fake I love your products but this one was one I expected to look different.<br />I’m having a time trying to return it I don’t know how to do this Before midnight Love the colors in these curtains. I got them to brighten up a slider in a room full of shiplap natural stain wood. Only problem is they are best closed because the pattern looks best that way. This is not usually my colors but I just love how beautiful and bold they are against the wood. They are not sheer at all and nice easy care material. Great quality and absolutely perfect! They were much thicker than I expected and it was a pleasant surprise. The colors are vibrant. Just what I was looking for! My new pool side view. Love it. Will be perfect for Christmas I use this in my office as a room divider for my massage bed. Just an extra step of privacy I bought this set of curtains to lighten up my basement apartment to make it feel more connected with the outside-- and its PERFECT.  It makes the whole dining room feel serene, and makes a delightful separation from my living to dining room area. Thick material. Very nice These are great! The printed pattern is clear and vibrant. The fabric is sturdy and has a silky look to it. And the stitching makes them very well made. Color dull not vibrant as picture Super cute! My daughter loves them for her cat themed bedroom! It\\'s nice. I recommend it. Only issue for me is I thought the top was lighter to match the wall. It\\'s to dark. These are big. All reviews are accurate are there good quality. But mine with the walkway to the beach just top is to dark and don\\'t match where needs to be.  If you care to alter this one you can take off some on the top and each side thou, make it about 75 inches tall and not as wide if you wanted to as it has those empty spots as see. I do like this alot I got it bc my Huzz &amp; I are both Leo\\'s this was so sweet.. &amp; We have this big ol slidin glass door to cover..but since we moved to AZ from LA we still not prepped for this kinda heat sittin in Satan\\'s livin room.  Must have the black out inside. I love this anyway so I hung it in front of the closet sliders as decoration (the closet doors are ugg anyway) so woooorked it out!! Yaaayuuuh! I hate returning Thicker fabric than expected, nice. Just as expected. For the price I expected the material to be a little bit better overall I’m satisfied with the curtains because they do what they say they will do and I love the picture that’s printed on them I just feel like for the quality of the material use the price could’ve been lower I like it is sheer enough to let light in and also allows privacy, not see through. It feels like art added to my space. The curtain is good quality, it\\'s blackout so you can\\'t see through, but I got two different lengths on either side. One is shorter and you can see the light coming through the space under the door. Curtains and a good price The windows look professionally done beautiful These curtains are so much nicer than I had imagined!  The quality of the fabric is just wonderful, and they are a beautiful, perfect addition to my jungle-themed bedroom.  I definitely recommend them. I\\'ve had these for at least a month now and I\\'m so grateful for my investment! Even though they aren\\'t living room curtains thats where I use mine. The colors really help brighten my room and mood. I love this curtain it\\'s more of a black out curtain than sheer more on the heavy side. I would definitely recommend this. The curtain picture will not look as bright or crisp as the one pictured in ad Nice Curtains go<br> in my music Fits perfect and medium desity to allow enough light but not sheer as to compromise privacy. No complaints here These are beautiful curtians and I really like the amazing work this company does in providing a way for someone who is living inland or in the desert to have a lovely tropical theme on thier wall or over thier windows all year around. We love the teal green color of the sea in these and deep soft tans of the sand. They are a thinker type of material so you can not really see through them but the sun does bring out the vibrance of the ocean scape at certian times of the day so much to the fact that you might feel like you are really there. There is one thing that I found over all with these drapes and others ones that I bought from this company, I felt that the sea line was a little low so if that bothers you you might have to do a little alterarations to get the sea line at eye level or where you need it to be. Over all, I recommend the purchase of these as they are surreal and truely have that calming beach feel allusion when you are around them. Closet doors. I feel like I need to say friend in Elvish to open them... These curtains were the perfect fit for my large window in my game room. They are translucent, letting in a bit of light but preventing people from looking in. The picture on the curtain is crisp and clear with nice coloring. Beautiful!!! In my opinion, the artwork appears more cartoon-like than rustic.  The quality and weight is quite good. My son like his curtains Good quality print, and curtains block out sunlight decently. Great value for price. We used this in place of two 96\" bi-fold closet doors in my son\\'s room.  He chose the design to personalize his room.  The curtains are thick and solid, will hold up well. Realistic, versatile and affordable! These curtains are fantastic.  Heavy fabric with awesome design. It brought my decor together. I loved these curtains! They are thick and very well made. The colors are extremely vibrant and looks more like a shower curtain because the finish is slick. The fabric is great and the construction is too. The image is really bad though, blurry abd you can’t even tell that it’s an archway. Don’t choose this design I recently purchased a home and created a Zen room for myself.  These were the perfect finishing touch. This worked so well to hide the laundry room that didn’t have a door in our rental home! When we move into our new home, I may convert these into a diy king size head board. I’ll update and post pics once I do. Love the vivid colors and so happy to find a length that would work for my needs. These aren’t high quality fabric as evidenced by the price. They block the sun’s rays just fine but I plan to add a white panel behind these to hide the lines of my blinds. Great fabric\\' will look nice for birthday party backdrop!!! very happy, not sheer but sunlight can filter thru Good quality material. and looks really nice The print quality is good and the fabric is very nice.  No complaints. In my head sheer means see through lol<br>These are thick curtains that provide privacy Finally have a music room and my diy Eddie Van Halen wall with these window treatments?! Rocks! Used as backdrop on pod cast interviews .. Exceeded my spectations Good price for the style. Dont expect them to be lined or anything but they worked for what I needed which was something with this kind of style and pattern Were as expected and good price for the style. Dont expect them to be lined or anything but they worked for what I needed which was something with this kind of style and pattern I like,I used for my Bedroom window<br />But tha produt come dirty Great colors, nice designs, slick and soft satin-like however strong fabric. Pictures are as shown, my kids are very happy with the sloth and with the fantasy ship curtains.  I hung each of them on the multi rail IKEA system. I have light green blackout curtains (see green rim on my pics) on the rail behind the sloth curtain and regular white blackouts behind the fantasy ship. This works great to block the light and adds to the design. I\\'ve had this curtain for my sliding door for a few years now. I\\'ve had a lot of people comment on how nice it is. It is well made, and even with full sun exposure all day the colors haven\\'t faded. I love it so much that I just bought a second one for the future, because I don\\'t think I could ever have a more perfect design for my home! I REALLY love this product and highly recommend it. These curtains are amazing !! I feel like I’m in the woods our a country back road in the trees watching the sun go down .. absolutely Best Buy !!<br>Love how the light comes through and makes them pop more !!! Win win ... Panels are only 87 and 88” long when hung and one panel is longer than the other. It is soooooo beautiful and lighten up the room. High quality and good value for your money.i bought both the long and short sizes. Makes my bedroom gorgeous  I had to return because the theme did t work for me but I wanted it for my skidding doors out to my lanai ! I was a great idea though and looked awesome  The color is pretty and the quality is good. Great addition to our bedroom on our sliding glass door! The material is not cheap - very good quality! Love love love These curtains are well made. Nice fabric. Thick enough you can’t see through. Brightens up any room. A big plus, my husband loves them too! These look great and makes the area fall like. This curtain was just beautiful.  Definitely black out,  lined nicely and well made.<br />I\\'m very happy with my purchase and would recommend highly. Would be a great shower curtain. Not meant for a coastal living room or bedroom Love the curtains! I am ecstatic with how realistic these are. I must confess from the minute I opened them I was so eager to see them up I hung them with thumbtacks. Of course, as you can see we are remodeling and these are a huge contribution to our scenery and theme. And I adore them. The fabric is not sheer and have a good backing for the image to show thru well. If you want to set a room apart this is the product you need. The size was right, but the actual colors of the real product are different from those pictured on the website. It is more pink than purple. Also, it was much heavier than I expected. So, I returned it. Great quality, colors and heavy weight. Looks really nice. I have hung them every way possible and cannot find that road that was showed on the picture but anyways they\\'re still nice for fall. A definite change from what I had before.  Allows the brightness of the sun to come through while still providing privacy. Covers the  bookcases.  Visual when entering the  front door.  Beautiful  Used this as a backdrop in my home theater, it looks great in there. It seems to add to the movie theater feel of the place. they are cute super big tho i should have Measured but they do the trick for our sons room theme The quality of material was nice, print is bright and clean.  The curtains look great. Great curtains I’m definitely satisfied not sure how they will look in the morning but so far so good. I love them honestly the quality is great. Looks exactly like the picture Overall lovely and arrived fast. One is a quarter inch longer than the other. Not a big deal in my installation. Love! Very thick and matches my bedspread perfectly. Bought the spread 2 yrs ago and couldn\\'t find matching curtains. Now a perfect set. VERY NICE Value  for money very good curtain fast shipping These curtains are really beautiful. Les deux rideaux n\\'ont pas la même longueur. Il décale de deux pouces. Il n\\'y a pas d\\'anneau au dessus alors ils glissent mal sur la pole. Ils sont plus transparent que sur l\\'image. Good Hard to see what is on the curtainsp The printing on the fabric is quite good, and the material is nice quality, and heavy. I am using it to disguise a movie projection screen, to avoid taking the screen down and putting it up for movie viewing. I deducted a star because the bottom is so wavy and not straight; it goes up considerably at each corner at the side seams. I will try to pick out a few stitches on the side seams to loosen it up and hit it with the iron to try to stretch the side seams down and thereby even out the hem at the bottom. I bought this for my large living area window that measures 108\".  The fabric was not something I\\'d want in any other room than say a basement family room. It will take some time to adjust to my new curtains, as I had heavy cloth material curtains that let in very little light before I purchased this set. I love the amount of light they allow through. I’m not big on the satiny material, but overall I’m happy with my purchase. These are the 90” length. Simply beautiful! Almost makes you feel like you\\'re there. Looks stunning at night from the outside looking in, as well. Works ver well for pantry. Also works very well for kitchen. Very complimentary. Adds color. Adds interest. Never overbearing. These drapes are  elequent and so beautiful , they light up my bedroom. There wrinkle free practically after ironing them. I pull them back and hardly any wrinkles at all. Mine are ceiling to floor and really make our home feel cozy. You can’t go wrong with these drapes , there made of heavy Satin and I just am thrilled to have Ambesonne Drapes in our home. Thank you Ambesonne. The curtains will be hung in my bedroom or guest room. Ther is nothing that I dislike about them Used for office Exactly as advertised, but better!  I really was not expecting the quality of fabric that it is. Nice and heavy and durable. I was leery on getting these in the past, because I wasn\\'t so sure about the image quality as well. The image is just as pictured, with rich color. My mom was so happy she received these Christmas drapes as a gift, that she bought another for 2 other side windows.<br /><br />I am going to try another pattern for my bedroom. Loving my new curtains highly recommended<br /><br />JAH BLESSINGS ❤ They are well made and the print is delightful however they look like a shower curtain , on a lovely window in my dinning room . I took them down and stored them away for other use . Perhaps 2 shower curtains . The curtains are thick enough but not too thick. Very nice material, looks good. I am a teacher and actually bought this to use as a curtain over my classroom closet! It is perfect! So unique and high quality! My students love it! The are white so they let in quite a bit of light but the are not plainly sheer. The map print is gorgeous and after a gentle hand wash and hang dry, the soft satin has a great feel. I would buy these again. Cures my homesickness lol love it So I got the curtains they are a good size and quality however they look nothing like pictured very upset would not purchase again Absolutely love these!  Good quality. Seems durable.  Covers the laundry area perfectly. Love the scene. Wanted to use for my window but was looking fake Good thank you It definately exceeds my expectation. So pretty The picture on the curtains are not recognizable.<br />Maybe the printing needs to be reevaluated. I love everything from this product will purchase from the company again. Quality is excellent, colors are vibrant, very beautiful Christmas curtains that I can\\'t wait to hang and display.  Well worth the money, good purchase. It’s a beautiful print. Print and size are just as described.  The clarity of the picture is perfect.  They will exactly serve the purpose I bought them for The picture was nice but it was too big for the space I needed it for.  I return back to Amazon I either received two left curtains or they don\\'t fade dark to light to the middle they sit side-by-side so it\\'s dark to light light to dark and that\\'s not how it shows in the picture it shows the the light is in the middle and it fades out towards the edges of the curtains but when you hang them that\\'s not how they look unless I got too long curtains I reported this issue and I got no response Very nice thank you I love the way this curtain looks great material! Beautiful waterfalls   I absolutely love these curtains. They are not cheaply made and the inside of the curtain, the side that faces the outside is white. It doesn\\'t allow a lot of light in if you want to keep the sun out. They are absolutely adorable. So glad I found them. The only similar style and mcm look was three times more. This is a good value. Wish the colors were slight more vivid, but I’m generally very happy with them. the print looks wonderful and it not too sheer I love all the bright autumn colors and I am gonna put them up in my living room. The curtain is lined with white fabric, making it look lighter than the ad photo. It also takes away from it looking like actual wood panels. It is a grainy print as well. Disappointed.. Colors are bright I really love these curtains Do not order from here. These curtains are nothing like what you see in the picture. There’s no blue anywhere and they’re two different colors. They have pink colors that were not in the picture obviously. It is beautiful and was thicker than I was under the impression. It\\'s beautiful, soft and it lives up to the quality. They are not black out curtains and they have a bluish tint when the sun is shinning through them which I didn’t care to much for but they are pretty love them  really love them he was so excited to put them up these curtains are very pretty and really nice quality of the thicknes and durability but still creats that pretty back ground for a girls room. Nice cloth material. Looks great in our room. Right size Print eill not line up to second panel.  One side lighter They make my colorful and inspirational office room look soo pretty! Love them! The material is really weird for a window curtain, but it would be a cute shower curtain. So pretty ! Delivery was fast, curtains had to be altered but thick enough to hang beautifully cannot see through the lining, love the colors..highly recommend Does not really block the sun. Or the street lights from outside for that matter. Feels like really cheap material that is very thin. Also where the shark is located is near the bottom of the curtain. It would look so much better if it was centered on the tapestry. Seasonal product love it. I have several different sets of these for seasonal purposes. Well-made recommend to anyone that likes to change out the curtains for seasons. I good quality. Recommend it to anyone I have Several for each season. It\\'s not well executed. I don\\'t necessarily mind the shearness. I added a photo of the curtains taken in the morning and at night.<br />The colors are nowhere near as vibrant as they are in the picture on Amazon.<br />My biggest issue is how shoddy this hem is. On both panels, the right part of the hem is crooked. It\\'s 1-2 inches too short on the sides as well as at the bottom, so the bad hem is obvious. Other curtains I own have anywhere from 1 to 4 inches of double fold at the hem, but this one doesn\\'t, so I can\\'t let it out to make up for the deficit. This hem has a 1-inch double fold and the very bottom is a solid color so I couldn\\'t let it out anyway..<br />I added photos to show that the scenes don\\'t exactly match up. The roof and patio in the center do not align.<br />The top has about a 1 and 1/2-in space to slide a curtain rod through. It does not have hooks so you would not easily be able to add backing to the curtain.<br />I was torn between rating this two or three stars. I would have rated it 2.5 if I could. Seam in middle doesn’t look good nan These curtains are absolutely beautiful. The fabric is like a heavy satin. The picture is stunning, inside and outside. Perfect for the months of September and October.  Loving it This is my 3rd Ambessome product and it is perfect- again! Purchased this for a “dead” wall in my finished basement where my treadmill is. Very depressing. It’s now awesome- visually expanded the room with a gorgeous back deck w a lake view. Lol! Curtain quality is good.thick not overly heavy- Totally pleased- I have 2 shower curtain scenes in my bathrooms that take me to the beach and Greece- love them. Ambessone Is  the best. Ordered a graphic shower curtain of another mfr and the photo quality was quite disappointing. The size was there but I was not impressed. It looks Ike a cartoon to me with the MIXED colors. I passed these along to my son to cover his sliding glass doors and they do that well. The print looks great, albeit too bright and could be better if darker and not so washed out looking. The material feels and looks quality and I expect he will get a lot of use out of them. Gorgeous Curtains.. The Quality is Really Nice. I Love it! The curtains are nice They don\\'t look like the pictures.  I had to buy some paint. fabric paint to paint more Brown. Other than that I love them Gorgeous, high quality curtains!!! LOVE them! Returned Didn’t work out Love the scenery for my home office! Great value, used it to cover a closet. Fabric is silky and good quality! Happy with this purchase to chase away the winter blues! The colors didn\\'t look the same as in the picture. Now my east facing window is like looking into the forest, I love these curtains! So glad that i had ordered them! The lighter (snow) parts of the picture aren’t very visible Love the design, because you can put up in any window and does not have to be next to each other. One curtain was a little bigger in width than the other but kept them anyway. Beautiful but like an inch to short for a normal window. Love these, very realistic. May be my fault but I thought these were thicker than what I received. The picture is beautiful but I had to put additional curtains behind these to help filter out the sun. May be my fault but I thought these were thicker than what I received. The picture is beautiful but I had to put additional curtains behind these to help filter out the sun.  Bellísima cortina soy muy aficionada a estos paisajes My living room I ordered these for my Sons bedroom. I really like the design on them. My only problem is. The windows I put them on are not that wide so you can’t really see the whole scene that’s on the curtains. I might return them only because they aren’t working for me and what I need. However, if you have wide windows and the curtains can be fanned out so the scene can be shown the proper way. Then they are worth it. The colors are not as vibrant as the picture and the curtains are kinda thick and polyester-looking.  Might return. Vibrant colors, beautifully designed. Highly recommend. Vibrant colors, beautiful curtains. Fair pricing. Highly recommend. This was for my Granddaughter, 15 years old, who loves Dungeon and Dragons.  This really finished off the room complementing all of her posters. I love these curtains and I found matching sheets also.  They just brought her he effect I was going for together ...the curtains allow light to come in and they are not heavy...if.you.but them, you can\\'t go wrong.. They cover my 108\" window and are beautiful! They let light through, but cannot see through them. Quality material, too. This makes my bathroom \"happy\" and festive.  Quality is good and I am certain I will use it for many years to come.  The hangers are cheesy but I have my own and didn\\'t need them. havent used yet  ----- its not christmas yet So my boyfriend ordered these for me an I was so in love w em but they ended up being a tad short for my windows an didnt have the size up that I needed so we had to send bck but I absolutely loved em an was so sad I had to return them! Super cute love it especially for fall and Thanksgiving that’s coming up material is thick.  just like the pictures colorful These curtians were nice quality and as pictured. I added red lights and drapes along each side to make it stand out even more. It was complimented all night at my Halloween party! Would recommend.   These curtains match almost anything, well made, no sun block out, but brightens the room without blinding.  Era para un regalo y la persona que le di el regalo quedó encantados The image was perfect and this is sturdy without being overly heavy. The image is exactly as pictured and the fabric thickness is sturdy but not overly heavy. I ironed and hung these curtains because I wanted to love them, but the wrinkles were incredibly hard set, they did not come out even with heavy steam, but they would probably have gotten better as they hung. However, the curtains did not look festive at all, just \"blah\", almost unattractive. The most prominent color is GRAY it doesn\\'t even look silver and the purple is drab so it doesn\\'t distract for the vast amount of gray. I am returning. Just got the curtains a few minutes ago.  I was expecting something thin and flimsy but that is not the case with these curtains.  These curtains are nice and thick, hvy duty type material.  I am very happy with them.  I put them up right away, okay, maybe a little eary for Christmas but when the spirit hits you ya know.  I would have liked a little wider option, maybe 60 or 72 inches wide for my purposes.  But they hang well and look very nice.  Debating about adding a second pair to get the pleating effect. Just perfect. The print is on one side only but good quality and vibrant color, Very happy with product will look to by from Ambersonne again much nicer than expected I was Very disappointed with my order when I hung up the curtains the colors was not vibrant. I live in a old drafty house and don’t want to heat the dining room. Last year I used gray curtains and I really needed something pleasant to look at. The colors are beautiful and it hangs on a tension rod nicely. I would prefer that it had grommets thought.<br>The first picture is of the BACK of the curtains a dark room to a lit room to give you a perspective on how much they block light.<br>** THEY ARE NOT PRINTED ON BOTH SIDES which is fine for me and not what I was looking for. This is hung with a tension rod and I would buy them again for $30. Very nice, thick Really cool look. Fabric is a sort of thick and smooth polyester. The image is printed really nicely, the colors are vibrant and the picture is detailed and high-res. They are light filtering, not blackout, which is what I wanted so I can\\'t complain. Makes my room look really modern! The hem is not even Bedroom I overall like ambesonne curtains and I own a few sets. Lately, I have been very disappointed because this is the second time in a month that a mistake has been made. In this order I received two completely different panels, with one panel having a sunset ocean scene. The panel photo does not match up well I returned these -- the fabric was more slippery texture than I expected, and I found the colors rather garish.  They were obviously printed and not woven, but that was as advertised.  I\\'m continuing to look, and now I have a better idea what I\\'m looking for. Blackout is perfect!! Bello diseño navideño  Cheap! Muy buena calidad! Thick material like I hoped it would be, feels like good quality! These curtains were perfect for our Harry Potter themed room. However, we were needing curtains that were not only stylish, but also able to block the light from the sun in the afternoon as this heats up the room. As others have mentioned the curtains are somewhat see-through which won’t help with the afternoon heat. Luckily, we also have blinds on the window to help so we will be keeping them. Other than the sheerness, they are neat curtains with the design on them. My son loves them.<br />Note: If you desire to have light blocked completely these are not the curtains you want/need. Love everything about these curtains except that they don\\'t quite meet in the middle so we had to move the ends in to make them flow. Should be just about two inches wider, but we\\'ve gotten use to them. These are really great holiday curtains. They are more like room darkening curtains than sheers, which I like better. The material is really nice and they are well made. The deal on price was exceptional.  Lots of designs to chose from. They are heavy, well made too!  I am very pleased with these panels!  I will order again.  Shipping was quick, curtains were ready to hang. These are pretty and the image is clear (not blurry), but the left curtain is shorter than the right curtain. Definitely not room darkening if that\\'s what you are looking for...but they are not sheer/see thru either. I have wooden blinds behind mine and they are in my office in my home, so the light isn\\'t as much of an issue for me. Muy fea la tela  son muy dificil de planchar esas tremendas arrugas no se Las pude quitar Vey attractive and a lot heavier than I thought. I used it for double closet doors. I loved everything about it! The actual picture is quite lovely, but the curtains are poorly hemmed; very uneven. I will need to take them apart to fix. I absolutely love these curtains!! They are great quality, look amazing and easy to put up! The curtains will be a beautiful addition to any room. Colors are vibrant and material is heavy enough to keep the cold out but light enough for the summer. Great price for the quality. Perfect fit for us The mixture of soft to dark colors in a scenic design add life to my Livingroom.  They have been up for about 1 month and I still find myself admiring them.<br>They are really nice to look at. Excellent quality. I am fully satisfied with the price, the look &amp; the ability to have my privacy in my apartment wit sunlight still able to come through during the day. Did not look like a waterfall,  uneven These curtains are cute. Came quickly. However the fabric is super shiny and just odd feeling. Ironing them to get wrinkles out was a challenge & some will have to “hang out”. It is exactly the color scheme I wanted though. They really are cute. Used as closet closure.  Put plastic pull curtain sticks to open and close.  Fits African decor perfectly and seems to cheer us up each morning. Stitching very bad and very uneven Just look at the picture I included but the sleigh and tree do not quite match up on the inside edge. The right curtain is lower but they still fit great lengthwise along my front window. Don\\'t like that I only got one panel. Otherwise I like the look and feel of it Beautiful! Blackout light very well<br>Love love<br>Picture is at 10am in a very sunny California They do well in my bedroom. They are not black out but you can see a shadow from outside. I would buy again. I also washed them on delicate before hanging and dried on perm press, no issues. And there up. I love them. I was afraid of them not being wide enough, or long enough, but this is a perfect fit.  It\\'s covering a big Bay window. I can\\'t see out, I\\'m pretty sure you can\\'t see in. It\\'s exactly what I wanted. I\\'ve ordered other curtains from this company and they are always beautiful. as you can see they aren\\'t wrinkle free but they are always true to color and description. I have yet to wash them, because I\\'m afraid to ruin them.  quality seems good These curtains are delightful. They are less white than they appear in the site picture. The colors are cheery and lively, and the tree itself is well designed and graceful. The picture is taken at night with our LEDs around our picture window. Very pleased with our purchase. Finally found Alice in Wonderland curtains for less than $50. They seem well made and hung easily. The fabric is decently heavy and hangs well. Because it\\'s mostly white they don\\'t block that much light but they are opaque so do ensure privacy. Overall, I\\'m quite happy. Overall, weight and texture is nice. However, there are splotchy marks on the curtain. The hexagons that make up the pattern are more oval shaped than honeycomb shaped. Beautiful! The sample shows beautiful colorful scenes, mine has one rose and the rest is all just print.<br />Not a happy customer. Good quality fabric. Made well! Vibrant colors. The picture isn’t pixelated and is very clear. Would purchase again. Thank you Ambesonne!  Great material and perfect for my outdoor Tropical Theme. I hung the curtain inside the house with the picture facing the outside. Couldn\\'t be more pleased how it transformed my patio into a paradise!<br />Picture 1- Outside view from my Patio<br />Picture 2 - Inside view with Drape closed<br />Picture 3 - Inside view with Drape opened It’s not super blackout curtain but it does the job!  Looks very rustic. Love this waterfall curtain. waterfall glows when sun is out I ordered three different curtain sets like this one. They were all spot on. For the price I was impressed.  The curtains I received were really nice.<br />Maby with other production runs the quality is lacking, which is why they got some bad reviews? I dont know. Got here quick!  Gonna enjoy seeing them on a daily basis I.love outdoor theme looks great Size 108x108 makes the Moon look a bit oval rather than circular, throws the aesthetic feel of the overall scene off. wish it were a circular moon. Worth the price if you can overlook the obvious flaw Great color and perfect for room darkening Pleased with product.  Realistic scene. Picture is realistic and is very pleasant to look at. Was a gift and the recipient was very pleased with the lovely picture and quality of material. Looks just as pictured and arrived in excellent condition. Used for privacy on porch sliding glass door. Delivered on time, lovely good  quality curtains, very pleased, thank you These curtains are awesome.  I removed my closet doors and hung them in there place.  Love them i purchased these to bring some life to my apt...i love them. it feels like im dining downtown at one of them fancy bistro, i love them. it adds so much life to my place. Great quality curtain panels that are light reducing. Beautiful design and phone booth is visible from the backside too. I just put these up and I absolutely love them.  They add so much cheer to my living room.  Happy, Happy!!! Using the set in my enclosed trailer to separate the sleeping area from the kitchenette area after the offroad toys are pulled out I bought these curtains for my teenagers room Your room looks like your in an expensive sky scraping apartment.  Very beautiful colors and shiny and pretty. We bought two different views of New York and we are enjoying the light changing and hi lighting different skyscrapers. Guest room decor I am totally in love with my curtains.  I have others curtains they are good material. However this particular set the scenary is not very clear like others I have I don\\'t know if is just mine or is the type of the land scape, scenery etc. what I did with this instead of hanging it as curtains, I took one part of it and I framed it came out a great picture hanging on my wall! producto de calidad Very nice curtain perfect for the season, fabric is nice and satiny  it doesn’t look cheap and it was not, I like it I really liked these so much I had to order a second pair for my slider...They fit and look great! Would order a third time! Great material! Not very sheer! These were used for a closet cover/backdrop for videos. Good product. Not quite as bright as pictured. White fabric on back. Allows light to pass. Creates a positive feeling with the earth tones. The curtains were well worth the money! I was impressed with the Mexican prints & material too! I would buy them again if I needed to! Not sheet like I expected.  But I like it anyway Love the design, nice silky material, and complements my other retro curtains I have this set on a tension rod on my porch to cover a window and add ambience to the bistro set. I think the set looks better from a distance but it is cool for where I have it. I love them they let light through but you can\\'t see through them , it\\'s not dark outside but tonight I will be going out there to see if you can see through them with the lights on and I\\'ll probably come back and give an update. They are good quality and very pretty , as others stated in past reviews they do basically match with anything , I had ordered numerous different curtains prior to these and returned all of them for bad quality,  I\\'m happy I found these ! I will remember this brand for now on when ordering curtains cuz I plan on doing my whole place   Están muy bien hechas, la costura es gruesa y la tela también, el diseño es muy claro, se nota perfecto, no se transparenta y lucen muy bien.  Yo las ame! Just received and put up right away. These are my second curtains from this store. I wanted a thick curtain since we are in a colder season, but not blackout. I also wanted something that would bring some life into the room since there isn\\'t any decor in there. Like the tropical scene while living in the cold. Excellent product . I advise everyone. I loved these Christmas curtains that I ordered, they are very beautiful and well made and they were shipped one day early. Very pleased. Good quality. Allows plenty of sun I wanted these to add a little more Christmas beauty to my living room. I saw these look good when used as backdrop for tree & this did not disappoint.  Very pretty. The white still lets in plenty of light without being too sheer.<br /><br />I love how the oversized bulbs help balance the look of a busy Christmas tree & other little things you might have out. It is an easy way to add a good, big point of balance without taking up much space in your house.<br /><br />I’d buy these again in a heartbeat. These are fun. I  like the material used . It allows light into the room ;made my room look  like a barn loft.. it\\'s beautiful but it\\'s not wrinkle free I watch it twice and then I iron it the wrinkles didn\\'t go away thank you These curtains look great and if you put a light behind them it looks real.  Customer service needs some help but product is great. muy bonito Print is clear. Curtains are heavy and well made. I received them in a very timely manner. Overall, very happy with the purchase. A beautiful curtain for my Asian theme room Deep wrinkles!!!! Waste of my time trying to get curtains straight. Would like a credit or refund for my hours of time please My daughter is a cowgirl and these make the best doors for her closet they’re absolutely beautiful I absolutely love these curtains!!! Buy these, they won\\'t disappoint! Actually the curtains ate quite nice, but they don\\'t fit, way too long and needed to be wider.  Would like to return Para mi sala Ordered some other Ambesonne scenery curtains last year and they are wonderful, but I\\'ve been looking at this design, baby deer in the forest, for a long time, so when they were available again, I ordered. As soon as I opened the package, I was disappointed.<br />The first design/scene that I purchased is bright and vibrant, real looking. These, not so much. One panel was lighter and brighter than the other, and the panel which included the scene with the baby deer couldn\\'t be distinguished because it was so dark. I sent them back, still waiting on my refund, but overall, I\\'d still recommend this kind of curtains - maybe just not this particular scene. The colors are not at all what the image leads you to believe. They are very dull and completely lifeless. A camera picks up all the colors well but to the eye it is not nearly as colorful. Used this to cover up garage storage.  Humongous difference! These give me something beautiful to look at all year. Picture is very colorful and take me on a brief mental vacation when I look at them. It never occurred to me that I could have beautiful scenic curtains. I have always had the boring one-color curtains.  They are well-made and I think they will last a long time. Would recommend them for anyone wishing for something attractive to look at. I have an art room and actually use this as a drape over the supply closet. It\\'s very pretty and hides a horrible mess. The fall colors are great and the sheer bright is great.  The blot of dark brown ink right in the middle of the curtain for all to see....say is not good.<br />I\\'m sad and mad. It\\'s in the kitchen so everyone sees it....want to return but then we will have no curtain.  Beware of this curtain it was...new? But has huge Ink stain I should have gotten a discount or sent a new one   The curtains does set the Christmas mode but the white background is not as white as it should b.  The red print bleed into the white background Not sheer at all (exactly as I needed) but the color appears a little more orange than I was expecting Fantastic color that bring the cosmos closet. Very nice fabric that provide shade from the sun. The fabric is of a good texture and weight. Glad I bought this Very nice curtains No need to wash. We hang it every Christmas as a background. Too dark This is a wonderful way to make a room festive Love them These are made nice love the vintage Christmas look !!! I purchased the Vintage Patchwork Design that in the sellers photo the colors are muted which I liked however what I received was a patchwork design with really bright colors (mostly a bright pink with white hearts - more for a little girls room) on very, very shiny fabric. Nothing muted about them so I will be returning and continue my search. Very unique. Keep the room dark and cool I disliked the color  the curtains were not as pictures.  Very disappointed I wanted something very unique for this new dwelling. Out of the ordinary and that is exactly what I got.<br />I have never seen curtains like this and not many have. Glad I took a risk! excelente compra These curtains are absolutely beautiful I put lights behind them and they looked wonderful These curtains form the backdrop of my store and they are perfect in all ways. Seemed perfect thickness Curtains were a total delight to have,gave the entire room a different dimension and was gorgeous. Worked perfect! The colors are strong and vibrant, but the whiteness of the curtain does allow body shadows to be seen at night, when lights are on.  I\\'ve washed the curtains in cold water, delicate cycle, and hung to dry, and there was no fading of the colors.  I\\'ve been very pleased with my purchase, and also bought a matching duvet cover. It came as ordered, looks just like the pic on Amazon, bought for slider door, we are very pleased me encataron estas cortinas se miran muy bonitas en mi sala a toda  mi familia y amistades que me visitaron les encanto como se miran I love the night and stars. This gives me a lovely, soothing view at night. Then I hung xmas lights behind it and now the stars in the scene are accompanied by twinkling ones. I absolutely loved the curtains. I feel like I\\'m sleeping in the forest. The curtains were a big hit with everyone who saw our decorations. We decorated our tree to match. Turned out great. Great deal on these & love the colors! I ordered this \"material\" not knowing specifically what I would use it for.<br />They are actually curtains (surprise) hemmed along the longer side.<br />A little confused why the seller would sell curtains as \"fabric\" but it works for me, coincidentally. I was very satisfied with this product the material was of good quality. This is absolutely adorable, colorful and looks great!! I love this curtains and bought the 2 matching pillow covers for my couch. I am so happy with how it looks and will be buying another in future. Great price and quality!! These curtain are the perfect length and the thickness is great too, they show just enough light through to look pretty in the mornings. Great quality! Love these curtains! Get compliments all of the time! Love it, exceeded my expectations In person the material texture is a bit disappointing, but I like the design enough to keep them until I decide to buy up or spend more money for cotton or linen. I\\'m generally pleased. Love these curtains.  It brightens up my home and makes the room festive.  I\\'ve gotten so many complements from my guests! Absolutely love it. When the sun comes through in the morning it\\'s gorgeous. If you look it as if you can put the walkway together. Not so.Two identical panels was received. More beautiful in person. It gives the entire room an amazing holiday feel. Fancy and blocks out light. Good product for the price…true to pictures and description!! wrong size ... i gave them away as a gift Everyone loved my fall curtains. They are even prettier then pictures shown. Nice and thick. Definitely worth the money spent. I would order again from this company. Love this drape. Perfect for our kitchen sliding door. Just the right amount of light coming through that shows the beautiful picture on the inside. Quality merchandise, great detail in design. First of all very high quality material.  Very heavy and thick and the print was just too blurry for me. Make sure you order the right size otherwise wow! Super nice curtains! Super pretty! HELPED TO BEAUTIFY THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT Great quality! They\\'re perfect for my themed party!! Very happy! I like the curtains but they tend to collect a lot of dust because of the static and they are easy to wash but if you can easily access them I don\\'t recommend the small maintenance you will need to do. But over they are great to look at and also need to be steam iron to remove the wrinkles. Prettiest curtains I ever saw!!! Like every thing about the curtains Returned Liked very much!!! It was perfectly matched with the rug I got these for my bar area to create an Italy Wine theme.I put them in front of my sliding glass door.PERFECT!!!!! I will be ordering more One pair in package. I needed two pairs. The vendor originally sent the wrong size curtain.  Once I received the correct size, curatin was made cheaply and of cheap fabric.  A total waste of money. I wasn\\'t sure from other reviews whether to buy, didn\\'t get accurate enough information.  Once I hung them, they looked so cool at my patio door which have panel blinds already.  During the day, curtains did not perform well and picture of them not really noticed however, when the sun went down, I did like the way they looked.  I hate that I took too much time to hang them because I would have returned them pronto.  Totally not worth what I paid.  I\\'ll have to put something more behind in order to get the pattern to show during daylight hours. Very cheesy color I chose mane the other options are better but not this one unfortunately. I love the fact..what u see u get.. Bought them for my best friend and she loves them!!! I loved it but I wish my window was a bit bigger to get the full affect 100% satisfied I like the curtains but each panel is a different length, 84 and 87 inches long. I reported this to the company. Hopefully they will correct this situation. Great product and price is super reasonable. I used mine as separation curtains. To hide storage  shelves and baskets and I love them! These are thick, well made curtains. They’re a little long, but with the design they will be simple to shorten. Great quality, horrible picture. One curtain had the elephant, the other side is all grey. I had to hide it. If you have tall ceilings, this is for you! Shiny and looks like a shower curtain Very well made and adorable for a relatively low price. Exactly as described and made with high quality material! Heavy good quality curtains.  Image is bright and in good focus.  Lovely addition to my salon holiday decor. I just hung them and the seam at bottom is not even some parts are longer than others still pretty Using it as a room divider to have some privacy in my wfh office. And it\\'s just much prettier than a solid wall of color. The print is very crisp.<br />It\\'s not sheer at all, but light does come through. Would 100% recommend. This material was way better than the photo provided. I am very happy with my purchase. I got lots of compliments. These are very long ( to the floor from the curtain rod ) but cover short windows as well also. Color contrast stands out in the room very well. Perfect for gamers and great and blocking light  Great product for reasonable money.  Delivered quickly.  At each stage of delivery, the seller sent SMS.  Recommend. Color is way off and panels do not match These are great for my studio as they complement the entire theme of the studio/living area.  The photo is first class, and the product is of very good quality. Brought out the beauty in kids room. They love it. Very cute curtains in my sons room! Thick enough to keep most of the light out.'"
